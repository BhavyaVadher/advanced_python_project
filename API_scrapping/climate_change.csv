There are even older ones, but this is a good start. This post will be updated from time to time as community members develop answers related to concerns like these. Until then, please read through some of the threads listed above. ",True,False,True,False
The r/climatechange Verified User Flair Program,30,technologyisnatural,1661115203.0,14,0.91,wu9zny,climatechange,False,"r/climatechange is a community centered around science and technology related to climate change. As such, it can be often be beneficial to distinguish educated/informed opinions from general comments, and verified user flairs are an easy way to accomplish this. 

# Do I qualify for a user flair?

As is the case in almost any science related field, a college degree (or current pursuit of one) is required to obtain a flair. Users in the community can apply for a flair by emailing [**redditclimatechangeflair@gmail.com**](mailto:redditclimatechangeflair@gmail.com) with information that corroborates the verification claim.

**The email must include:**

1. At least one of the following: A verifiable .edu/.gov/etc email address, a picture of a diploma or business card, a screenshot of course registration, or other verifiable information.
2. The reddit username stated in the email or shown in the photograph.
3. The desired flair: **Degree Level/Occupation | Degree Area | Additional Info**  (see below)

# What will the user flair say?

In the verification email, please specify the desired flair information. A flair has the following form:

>USERNAME    **Degree Level/Occupation | Degree area | Additional Info**

For example if reddit user “Jane” has a PhD in Atmospheric Science with a specialty in climate modeling, Jane can request:

>Flair text: PhD | Atmospheric Science | Climate Modeling

If “John” works as an electrical engineer designing wind turbines, he could request:

>Flair text: Electrical Engineer | Wind Turbines

Other examples:

>Flair Text: PhD | Marine Science | Marine Microbiology
>  
>Flair Text: Grad Student | Geophysics | Permafrost Dynamics
>  
>Flair Text: Undergrad | Physics  
>  
>Flair Text: BS | Computer Science | Risk Estimates

Note: The information used to verify the flair claim does not have to corroborate the specific additional information, but rather the broad degree area. (i.e. “John” above would only have to show he is an electrical engineer, but not that he works specifically on wind turbines).

# A note on information security

While it is encouraged that the verification email includes no sensitive information, we recognize that this may not be easy or possible for each situation. Therefore, the verification email is only accessible by a limited number of moderators, and emails are deleted after verification is completed. If you have any information security concerns, please feel free to reach out to the mod team or refrain from the verification program entirely.

# A note on the conduct of verified users

Flaired users will be held to higher standards of conduct. This includes both the technical information  provided to the community, as well as the general conduct when interacting with other users. The moderation team does hold the right to remove flairs at any time for any circumstance, especially if the user does not adhere to the professionalism and courtesy expected of flaired users. Even if qualified, you are not entitled to a user flair.

Solar and wind are better than nuclear,21,Consistent_Piano_210,1698005642.0,26,0.7,17e251o,climatechange,False,"Taken from a discussion:

Nickel Iron batteries do last for more than 100 years.  They can be easily repaired (after 100 years plus of use), if they need to be, by a layperson, for continued use thereafter.  

Wind turbines consist of components that can ALL be repaired, refurbished, re-used, or recycled.  Specifically wind turbines consist of the blades to catch the wind, a gear and rod system, a motor/generator (stator and rotor, consisting of repairable, refurbishable, or easily re-usable or recyclable materials).  Solar panels can be refurbished.  Lets consider all of the materials used in solar panels minus the photovoltaic cells first.  They can all be re-used or recycled.  Spent photovoltaic cells have begun to be refurbished and recycled as well.

Nuclear reactor waste release radiation for hundreds of millions of years.  This is a permanent positive rate of damage to surrounding life on Earth.  This is well known.  Not to mention that accidents (which would be minor in any other case) are catastrophic to the extreme.  See the Marshall Islands, Fukushima, etc.  Nuclear reactors are a HUGE liability.

Nuclear has literally double to triple the cost to build compared to solar or wind.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#Capital_costs

If you install a complete solar panel and battery system yourself to get off the grid, you get a variable return on investment, that increases exponentially with how little you spend a month on electricity.  This asymptotes at about 14% as the amount spent on electricity goes up, and increases to infinity as you spend less on electricity per month.  If you spend very little on electricity, using all the most efficient appliances you can get, you'll likely get a 100-200% return on your investment.  This assumes 8 hours of sunlight per day.

Again, Nickel Iron batteries have an even higher return on investment than the best batteries in common use today (LiFePh).  They are relatively simple to build, and they are incredibly clean for battery technology.  If production were scaled up, their price would fall by more than half.

In comparison, if you get consistent 14mph winds, wind turbines cost a QUARTER of what solar panels cost to produce the same amount of electricity (watts).

These technologies OBVIOUSLY do not need government subsidies to be viable.  A 14% return on investment (the lowest possible ROI on solar panels assuming 8 hours of sun a day, and installing them yourself) is objectively worth the cost.  A 30%, 100%, 200% ROI is a what might be meet the technical standards of the term, ""a no-brainer"".  Even a 14% ROI would be a no-brainer for someone with a basic knowledge of the concept of investment.

Compared to solar and wind, the initial cost of a nuclear plant per watt generated is literally 2-3x as much to build.  That means that per dollar, you can get 2-3x as many watts from solar panels and wind, including the battery system to provide electricity during down-times.

Sure there are places that don't get sun or wind, and it's worth it to have the capability of building a nuclear plant in your toolbelt, but people should be cognizant and acknowledge the facts, and optimize the use of limited funding, workforce, and resources in general, when building electricity production facilities.  Nuclear is an objectively sub-par option in the vast majority of cases, and an objectively horrible option in many cases.

Solar and wind also have a lot more room for improvement compared to nuclear, in terms of efficiency.  Solar and wind have the potential to be improved by 800%, compared to only 6% with nuclear, in terms of efficient capture of energy.  (See the CF rating in the Wikipedia link above.)

When will we hit 2 degrees of global warming?,9,ging289,1698013200.0,30,0.74,17e506w,climatechange,False,"Now we can't avoid hitting 1.5 degrees so I ask: when will we hit 2 degrees of global warming? when will the point be where we can no longer avoid hitting 2 degrees?

I ask because I tried to find out about this but didn't get a definitive answer: I only got 2 articles: one article(https://amp24.ilsole24ore.com/pagina/ACxDIjU) says that human civilization will literally DISAPPEAR by 2050 as global warming will even exceed 3 degrees because in addition to industrial climate warming there will be an acceleration due to the fact that too many pressure points have been passed and global warming is now self-sustaining and two billion people will die of hunger and there will be billions of climate refugees.

another article instead(https://www.eticasgr.com/storie/news-eventi/cambiamento-climatico-riscaldamento-globale) says that although there are atrocious scenarios there will not be the end of the world by 2050.

now I want the REALISTIC analysis (not optimistic, not pessimistic, REALISTIC) regarding the path we are CURRENTLY taking towards global warming, when we realistically reach 2 degrees and the forecasts of the consequences of what it will have.
because I heard some users say that now even the WORST scenario is too realistic because things like ""the Amazon forest which has become positive for carbon dioxide and is therefore dying quickly"" have not been included in the calculations so humanity could end really by 2050.

How a sticky self-concept prevents us from acknowledging climate change,21,EducatedGuessStack,1697995944.0,34,0.93,17dyk6u,climatechange,False,"Hey all, I'm a neuroscientist and psychologist trying to use science to make sense of society. I've been writing on psychological aspects of climate change for a little while, and explored the relevance of the self-concept in a new essay.

In brief I think that we're not taking enough action on climate change (either preventative or adaptational) because we're resistant to incorporating the changing climate into our collective image of ourselves. This is not explicit climate denialism, but a more implicit sluggishness of our self-concept.

Would love to hear if you think this makes sense and, if so, what we can do to come to terms with change.

Ok, I'll reply. I really don't need to have academia tell me anything about Anthropogenic Climate Change. All that I need to do is look and see. I live in California. I know, I know get it all out... Here in California we have a thing called Atmospheric Rivers that occasionally happened and usually happened when an El Nino or Nina what occur. El Ninos and Ninas had a cycle. Every 3 to 5 years one would occur. They don't anymore. They're still called El Nino or Nina but they are something different and the cycle is different. There isn't one. When I heard on our local news that it may be another El whatever and it ""petered out"" and didn't occur then WTF? NOAA wanted to start categorizing Atmospheric Rivers because of their rising frequency. Back to Back slamming the Sierras. Took So Cal out of a 20 year drought in a 2yrs. Before NOAA starting to categorize atmospheric rivers they didn't care about it because it was infrequent and they just didn't care. They do now.

I remember in the late 80's David Suzuki had a 3hr special on PBS called Global Warming. It was about three of the biggest CRAY supercomputers. They were at some university in CA (UCLA?), a Japanese Corporation and in Britain somewhere. Three different places that had at the time the biggest computers. All three were independently trying to look in to the future and create a model for what earth will look like in X amount of years. If there was a trend and how would that look like. It took years because any small variance or slight difference in data changed the outcome drastically. The biggest stumbling block for them at the end was, of all things, clouds. How did clouds work with heat and radiation bouncing, absorbed and or reflecting. They didn't know and it was complex. They finally had what they thought was the best data to plug in to the supercomputers. I forgot which one was the best or had the biggest computer array but one came up with the best ""outlook"". Sea level rising and taking away The Keys, The Barrier Islands, Parts of Boston, Parts of the California Coast all the way up to Alaska, New York City doesn't fair well either. High winds, tornadoes, floods slamming the Midwest then excessive heat destroying our ""bread basket"". The Great Lakes dumping down into the Mississippi causing massive flooding. Greater and more frequent hurricanes up the Eastern Seaboard. Greater and more frequent tornadoes ripping through tornado alley.

It was fucked up other than CA becoming more tropical, which it is, because I like the tropics. Anyhow, this was predicted in the 80's. Oil corporations knew about how bad burning things in order to propel ourselves was bad for us in the 70's but probably before that. The 50's.

My favorite is, ""it's God's will"". I just don't have the time or bandwidth patience to even try with that. However, ""it's just normal earth cycles"" just seems either you/they are stuck in a bubble of buddies, family, maybe small town that doesn't allow for researching or just willfully ignorant.

Why is the climate change cost in terms of GDP relatively low in the current white house and IPCC reports,9,badhoccyr,1697498825.0,43,0.7,179k1l6,climatechange,False,"The white house has a report from this year, as well as last year and there's an IPCC report  on the actual cost of climate chagne. They all line up more or less. Basically even if we end up with 3 degrees the cost of climate change by 2100 will be still less than 1% of GDP annually if i understand correctly. Transitioning with current tech will cost at minimum 5% annually from what i understand. Now that is US based, while the IPCC is a global estimate. Maybe either way the cost would need to be subsidized by the developed world.

There's several things the IPCC has anything more than medium confidence on. Ecological droughts (not any other type of drought), extreme heat, mean air temperature, cold spells, permafrost, lake river and sea ice, mean ocean temperature, ocean salinity, dissolved oxygen, atmospheric CO2 at surface

Ecological droughts can be solved with desalination, we'd realistcally need to help other countries finance it tough. Desalination is used at mass scale already, ie, gulf states, israel, california

We don't have actual food shortages except from a distribution point of view and our yields are going up at a mind boggling rate from continued tech advances in agri tech.

I do not understand the damage of ocean temp, salinity, and dissolved oxygen well, i'd welcome someone chiming in here. Maybe this wouldn't factor well into the GDP cost as seafood is a minority in calories per capita, 7-8 percent roughly. Would we lose a lot of biodiversity in the Oceans?

As far as cold spells and extreme heat events, it is energy that solves this for us. However, once again any other species that does not own Air conditioner is disrupted. How bad is this?

As far as humans, it is energy that keeps people from freezing to death or overheating to death. In the poorest countries they are very price sensitive and the cost of energy can mean life and death for the poorest of us. If we penalize the supply chain of fossil fuels too much we have high energy prices that affect people severely in developing nations, can cause geopolitical instability and could lead to more war as in a tight energy market we have less ability to sanction.

I'd like to test a point a view to be debated on that disrupting civilization by going too fast or in a way that's too penalizing could cost more than 1% and that ""cost"" in both scenarios do incorporate human suffering, what are your thoughts? However, would we still want to make that trade-off for all the reasons that don't get represented well in GDP cost, like loss of biodiversity for example, and what are those costs that are not represented in the GPD cost?

We should obviously do this with urgency. But is there a level where it actually becomes more harmful to us? Also how do we do it? I'm particularly interested how we do it if nuclear is off the table?

Why not nuclear power pt. 2,38,NoAstronaut4900,1697384180.0,199,0.74,178hz3g,climatechange,False,"Hi, I posted the original response a few days ago here and have read through many responses. Many people had sensible posts that were not overly mean or cynical. Thank you.

Overall, I feel that I was wrong that nuclear power is our only option and people made some great arguments for and against it.

Here is my big takeaway. Mathematically speaking, it doesn’t make sense to invest heavily in *new* nuclear plants. The cost and time, even for newer generation models, still greatly exceeds other renewable, such as solar and wind. There is just more energy return on investment with solar and wind.

Additionally, the carbon output is takes to build a plant is so great it would take years until the plant off sets there original co2 emissions. There is also always the problem of nuclear waste.

The path forward seems to look something like this:

1. Heavily invest in R&D and construction of solar, wind, and geothermal energy sources. 
2. Update the electrical grid to help the flow of clean energy sources.
3. Invest in energy storage
4. Keep existing, functional nuclear plants operating.
5. Continue to convert all engines that run on fossil fuels to electrical powered. 
6. Reduce energy usage (although this seems least likely to change since it requires the population to change their habits)

Obviously, this is super simplified and a someone posted a great link an IEA that gives a lot of helpful information about a path forward. Check it out here.

Staggering. Unnerving. Mind-boggling. Absolutely gobsmackingly bananas.

As global temperatures shattered records and reached dangerous new highs over and over the past few months, my climate scientist colleagues and I [have](https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins/status/1709825752705753105) just about run out of adjectives to describe what we have seen. Data from [Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/september-2023-temperature-update/) released on Wednesday shows that September was an astounding 0.5 degree Celsius (almost a full degree Fahrenheit) hotter than the prior record, and July and [August](https://berkeleyearth.org/august-2023-temperature-update/) were around 0.3 degree Celsius (0.5 degree Fahrenheit) hotter. 2023 is almost certain to be the hottest year since reliable global records began in the mid-1800s and probably for the [past 2,000 years](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0400-0) (and [well before that](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/july-2023-is-hottest-month-ever-recorded-on-earth/)).

While natural weather patterns, including a [growing El Niño event](https://iri.columbia.edu/our-expertise/climate/forecasts/enso/current/), are playing an important role, the record global temperatures we have experienced this year could not have occurred without the approximately 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) of [warming to date](https://climatechangetracker.org/igcc) from human sources of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. And while many experts have been cautious about acknowledging it, there is increasing evidence that global warming has accelerated over the past 15 years rather than continued at a gradual, steady pace. That acceleration means that the effects of climate change we are already seeing — extreme heat waves, wildfires, rainfall and sea level rise — will only grow more severe in the coming years.

I don’t make this claim lightly. Among my colleagues in climate science, there are sharp divisions on this question, and [some](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2023/07/23/climate-crisis-warming-is-right-in-line-with-early-predictions-but-many-of-the-impacts-are-exceeding-predictions_6063986_114.html) aren’t convinced it’s happening. Climate scientists generally focus on longer-term changes over decades rather than year-to-year variability, and some of my peers in the field have expressed concerns about overinterpreting short-term events like the extremes we’ve seen this year. In the past I doubted acceleration was happening, in part because of a long debate about whether global warming had paused from 1998 to 2012. In hindsight, that was [clearly not the case](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22315). I’m worried that if we don’t pay attention today, we’ll miss what are increasingly clear signals.

I wouldn’t be making this argument if I didn’t have strong evidence to back it up; the data we’re getting from three sources tells a worrying story about a world warming more quickly than before. First, the rate of warming we’ve measured over the world’s land and oceans over the past 15 years has been 40 percent higher than the rate since the 1970s, with the past nine years being the nine warmest years on record. Second, there has been [acceleration](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/35/14/JCLI-D-21-0895.1.xml) over the past few decades in the total heat content of Earth’s oceans, where over 90 percent of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is accumulating. Third, [satellite measurements](https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/science/) of Earth’s energy imbalance — the difference between energy entering the atmosphere from the sun and the amount of heat leaving — show [a strong increase](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/essd-15-2295-2023.html) in the amount of heat trapped over the past two decades. If Earth’s energy imbalance is increasing over time, it should drive an increase in the world’s rate of warming.

There are a number of factors driving the acceleration of warming. While the world has [made real progress](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/10/25/climate/world-climate-pledges-cop26.html) in slowing down the growth of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, they have yet to peak and decline. And on top of this, we are reaping the results of what the climate scientist James Hansen [calls](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/opinion/columnists/the-faustian-bargain-of-reducing-air-pollution.html) our “Faustian bargain” with air pollution. For decades, air pollution from sulfur dioxide and other hazardous substances in fossil fuels has had a strong temporary cooling effect on our climate. But as countries around the world have begun to clean up the air, the cooling effect provided by these aerosols has [fallen by around 30 percent](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/essd-15-2295-2023.html) since 2000. Aerosols have fallen even more in the past three years, after a decision to largely [phase out sulfur](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-low-sulphur-shipping-rules-are-affecting-global-warming/) in marine fuels in 2020. These reductions in pollution on top of continued increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations mean that we are encountering some of the unvarnished force of climate change for the first time.

Until recently, climate change was framed as an issue that would affect our children. Today it is nearly omnipresent, and it is impossible to ignore. And very soon, with the acceleration, we will experience even more of its effects: Ice sheets and glaciers will melt faster, extreme weather events will become more frequent, and even more plants and animals will be put at risk of extinction.

Does this acceleration mean that warming is happening faster than we thought or that it is too late to avoid the worst impacts? Not necessarily. Amazingly enough, this acceleration quite closely matches [what climate models have](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4/) projected for this period. In other words, scientists have long foreseen a possible acceleration of warming if our aerosol emissions declined while our greenhouse gas emissions did not. That’s what we’re now seeing. This may not make you feel much better about the future of warming but should at least make you feel better about our models and the power of science to prepare us for what’s to come.

It’s now clear that we can control how warm the planet gets over the coming decades. Climate models have [consistently found](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached/) that once we get emissions down to net zero, the world will largely stop warming; there is no warming that is inevitable or [in the pipeline](https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/warming-in-the-pipeline-decoding) after that point. Of course, the world will not cool back down for many centuries, unless world powers join in major efforts [to remove](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-what-the-new-ipcc-report-says-about-how-to-limit-warming-to-1-5c-or-2c/) more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than we add. But that is the brutal math of climate change and the reason we need to speed up efforts to reduce emissions significantly.

On that front, there is some reason for [cautious hope](https://swac.umn.edu/events/kuehnast-lecture-2022). The world is on the brink of a clean energy transition. The International Energy Agency [recently estimated](https://www.iea.org/news/the-path-to-limiting-global-warming-to-1-5-c-has-narrowed-but-clean-energy-growth-is-keeping-it-open) that a whopping $1.8 trillion will be invested in clean energy technologies like renewables, electric cars and heat pumps in 2023, up from [roughly $300 billion](https://about.bnef.com/blog/global-low-carbon-energy-technology-investment-surges-past-1-trillion-for-the-first-time/) a decade ago. Prices of solar, wind and batteries have plummeted over the past 15 years, and for much of the world, solar power is now the [cheapest form of electricity](https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea/). If we reduce emissions quickly, we can switch from a world in which warming is accelerating to one in which it’s slowing. Eventually, we can stop it entirely.

We are far from on track to meet our climate goals, and much more work remains. But the positive steps we’ve made over the past decade should reinforce to us that progress is possible and despair is counterproductive. Despite the recent acceleration of warming, humans remain firmly in the driver’s seat, and the future of our climate is still up to us to decide.

Abstract:

>Antarctic ice shelves moderate the contribution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to global sea level rise; however, ice shelf health remains poorly constrained. Here, we present the annual mass budget of all Antarctic ice shelves from 1997 to 2021. Out of 162 ice shelves, 71 lost mass, 29 gained mass, and 62 did not change mass significantly. Of the shelves that lost mass, 68 had statistically significant negative mass trends, 48 lost more than 30% of their initial mass, and basal melting was the dominant contributor to that mass loss at a majority (68%). At many ice shelves, mass losses due to basal melting or iceberg calving were significantly positively correlated with grounding line discharge anomalies; however, the strength and form of this relationship varied substantially between ice shelves. Our results illustrate the utility of partitioning high-resolution ice shelf mass balance observations into its components to quantify the contributors to ice shelf mass change and the response of grounded ice.

How screwed is Florida in the medium term?,165,HistoricalPrize7951,1697081774.0,541,0.78,175xbov,climatechange,False,"I might end up living in Florida. I know in the long term, sea level rise will put a large fraction of Florida underwater, but I’m really concerned with what’s going to happen in the next 10-20 years.

I plan to live about 3 miles in from the coast, on somewhat higher ground (for Florida). Is sea level rise really going to be an issue that far in by 2040?

Hurricanes are obviously an issue, but if you are inland and not in a low area, most homes don’t actually see any flooding, just wind and rain, at least so far. What’s the worst a hurricane could do if you’re not on the coast?

And finally, what’s the heat forecast looking like? I can tolerate mid to high 90s and humid for a few months (the current summer temps) but if we hit 100+ and humid regularly that’s a dealbreaker.

What is you opinion about how climate scientists are using social media?,26,carlitos_sagan,1696603833.0,90,0.8,171eb9m,climatechange,False,"I'm a regular on Twitter - I know, not exactly a bragging point - and I often see climate scientists posting their latest findings and speculating on what they could mean. I get that they may be doing this with the best of intentions and almost as a cry for help to be heard, but I'm not sure it's working. Here's why:

1. When scientists share new findings with the general public, who aren't climate experts, it often leads to confusion because there can be a ton of expert views on the same discovery. Don't you think it'd be smarter to hash out these discoveries within academic circles until there's a common ground or better understanding, instead of tossing out initial data to the public and jumping to conclusions?

2. A lot of these posts are really intense, full of doom and gloom. This can make people feel helpless, especially those who are worried about the climate crisis. Some scientists are even saying we've crossed a point of no return, predicting a dystopian Mad Max-style future by the century's end, if not sooner. To me, that feels reckless. Yes, the situation is serious, but there are so many variables at play to make such absolute predictions. Worse, these doom-filled messages could lead people to think there's no use in even trying. It seems like these messages are more likely to discourage action than encourage it.

3. Publicly sharing these views invites trolls and climate change deniers to flood the comments with contrary opinions, dubious graphs, and wild theories. I wonder how many people genuinely interested in the climate crisis get swayed by these deniers' arguments.

During the peak of the COVID pandemic, similar patterns emerged on social media. Experts presented complex data and personal opinions regarding vaccine efficacy and the risks posed by new virus strains, aiming to inform the public. However, this often resulted in greater confusion, anxiety, and doubt instead of clarity. It seems we're repeating this scenario with climate scientists.

I'm not sure what the best approach is, but perhaps scientists could avoid sharing unreviewed findings or those that haven't been thoroughly debated academically.

Empirical assessment of the role of the Sun in climate change using balanced multi-proxy solar records,1,Ovaz1088,1696602663.0,1,0.54,171dtrp,climatechange,False,"Highlights

•
The role of the Sun in climate change is hotly debated with diverse models.

•
The Earth’s climate likely influenced by the Sun through a variety of physical mechanisms.

•
Balanced multi-proxy solar records created and their climate effect assessed.

•
Factors other than direct TSI forcing account for around 80% of the solar influence on the climate.

•
Important solar-climate mechanisms to be investigated before developing reliable GCMs.

The result also suggests that at least about 80% of the solar influence on the climate may not be induced by TSI forcing alone, but rather by other Sun-climate processes (e.g., by a solar magnetic modulation of cosmic ray and other particle fluxes, and/or others), which must be thoroughly investigated and physically understood before trustworthy GCMs can be created. 

This result explains why empirical studies often found that the solar contribution to climate changes throughout the Holocene has been significant, whereas GCM-based studies, which only adopt radiative forcings, suggest that the Sun plays a relatively modest role.",False,False,False,False

Research suggests that the actual social cost of co2 is $185 per metric ton,133,Dylan0110,1696374243.0,172,0.88,16z6ki3,climatechange,False,"

Abstract
The social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) measures the monetized value of the damages to society caused by an incremental metric tonne of CO2 emissions and is a key metric informing climate policy. Used by governments and other decision-makers in benefit–cost analysis for over a decade, SC-CO2 estimates draw on climate science, economics, demography and other disciplines. However, a 2017 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine1 (NASEM) highlighted that current SC-CO2 estimates no longer reflect the latest research. The report provided a series of recommendations for improving the scientific basis, transparency and uncertainty characterization of SC-CO2 estimates. Here we show that improved probabilistic socioeconomic projections, climate models, damage functions, and discounting methods that collectively reflect theoretically consistent valuation of risk, substantially increase estimates of the SC-CO2. Our preferred mean SC-CO2 estimate is $185 per tonne of CO2 ($44–$413 per tCO2: 5%–95% range, 2020 US dollars) at a near-term risk-free discount rate of 2%, a value 3.6 times higher than the US government’s current value of $51 per tCO2. Our estimates incorporate updated scientific understanding throughout all components of SC-CO2 estimation in the new open-source Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) model, in a manner fully responsive to the near-term NASEM recommendations. Our higher SC-CO2 values, compared with estimates currently used in policy evaluation, substantially increase the estimated benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation and thereby increase the expected net benefits of more stringent climate policies.",False,False,False,False

Examples:

Q: The increase from 300 ppm to 400 ppm CO2 is only +0.01%, such a small amount can obviously not have any impact.

A: The absolute increase from \~1930 to 2015 is indeed about +100 ppm, which is 0.01%. That is +0.01% of the absolute value, but about 34% increase, which has a huge effect.

&#x200B;

Q: Since 1960, polar bears in the Arctic have increased from 5,000 to over 25,000! Obviously, there is more ice!

A: Technically, there is no question about it, but the reason is hunting restrictions imposed by the Arctic states since the 1970s.

&#x200B;

Q: Only 3% of CO2 emissions are man-made! The remaining 97% come from nature. So how can humans be responsible?

A:  Nature cycles approximately 1200 billion tons of carbon annually, a process akin to its 'breathing'. The same 1200 billion tons are absorbed back by nature. Humans, on the other hand, contribute 37 billion tons of carbon annually without a corresponding natural absorption mechanism.

When you divide the world, there is the “West” and the “East” (think BRICCS+).

1. If both the West and East cooperate, they will both incur a decrease in standard of living and quality of life, but benefit from non-extinction.

2. If either the West or East give up fossil fuels, but the other does not then you end up with a slower extinction, but the nations not giving up fossil fuels will likely lead a generally better standard of living / quality of life. 

3. If neither gives up fossil fuels, extinction is imminent and both continue on as they are today. 

The interesting piece comes down to Point 2. With the rise of BRICCS+ I predict that it is far more likely that Point 2 will win out. And I would also predict it will be BRICCS+ that continues and further advances the adoption of fossil fuels. 

This leads me to a logical endpoint I can’t seem to shake: If you firmly believe climate change is an extinction level event, then you must be ready to go to war in the name of climate change at some point. For, if you do not, then you will certainly go extinct.

Antarctic Sea Ice and Ozone Hole,0,Honest_Cynic,1696285743.0,3,0.44,16yan84,climatechange,False,"This report is alarming, and purposely so (click-bait):

[https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/ozone-day-2023-why-the-south-pole-has-set-alarm-bells-ringing-this-year-91787](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/ozone-day-2023-why-the-south-pole-has-set-alarm-bells-ringing-this-year-91787)

We've discussed the lesser sea ice this Antarctic Winter, which reached a lesser max extent that past years, though exceeded the median extent line on the Western side (Peninsula, towards S. America) and a few other places.  So let's review the other concern, the Ozone Hole (OH), which has recently been tied to Climate Change (CC), and in both directions.

First, it is humorous that when OH was smaller in 2019 than years since measurement began in the 1980's, the U.N. was crowing ""Fixed it by eliminating CFC's per Montreal Protocol"".  Those reports are hard to find now since apparently buried and promoting a new story.  The reason being that in following years OH was larger than ever and 2023 may turn out the largest still.  They respun that by claiming models showed upper atmosphere circulations, due to CC (Polar Vortex, PV) cooled the Stratosphere, to form more ice crystals which decrease the ozone.  This only occurs during Antarctic Winter, when almost no sun, so I've never understood the fuss about ""increased uV on ground"", but the concern was that OH would eventually extend to temperate latitudes.  A 2019 link about ""fixed 'er"",  followed by a link with ""new 'xplainin"" (PV), plus blaming the even bigger OH in 2023 on the Tonga volcano:

[https://www.euronews.com/2019/09/16/current-ozone-hole-could-be-one-of-the-smallest-in-30-years-copernicus](https://www.euronews.com/2019/09/16/current-ozone-hole-could-be-one-of-the-smallest-in-30-years-copernicus)

[https://www.space.com/antarctic-ozone-hole-early-hunga-tonga](https://www.space.com/antarctic-ozone-hole-early-hunga-tonga)

This link argues the ""other way"", that OH increase CC.  They quote a scientist speculating that increased uV hitting the ice/ocean will significantly increase the radiant heat input from the sun.  I say ""speculate"" because no link to calculations to support that claim.  Relatively little energy in sunlight is in the uV.  It is more a concern for skin cancer than radiant energy.  There is little sunlight in Antarctic Winter when OH exists.  Hopefully, more to come.  I see too many unsupported CC claims which are never challenged, and predictions which are quickly forgotten (or buried) when they don't come true.

Make it rain,12,jgambs,1696097245.0,18,0.8,16wdkfg,climatechange,False," 

As the oceans heat up, the number and severity of hurricanes will increase. Hurricanes begin as tropical disturbances where a low-pressure area is formed. The low pressure creates an updraft with strong winds, which causes the ocean to evaporate more rapidly, creating a stronger storm. As this cycle repeats over thousands of miles of travel over the oceans, it becomes incredibly powerful, growing exponentially. When the hurricane reaches the shore, it causes tremendous damage to the shore, but it quickly weakens once it is over land instead of water.

If the low-pressure zones form close to shore, they increase in strength as they travel over the ocean, but they do not have enough time to become destructive before making landfall. Because of this, their only effect is to increase rainfall, cool the oceans, and create more clouds, which help reflect the sun’s energy back into space. All of these are good things.

Intense low-pressure zones can form naturally due to baroclinic instability. Horizontal differences in air temperature and pressure create vertical wind shear. The wind shear creates waves in the atmosphere, and if the interference pattern of the waves is constructive, it causes the magnitude to increase.

Instead of waiting for baroclinic instability to occur naturally, we could try to create them. Water evaporation and condensation absorb and release tremendous amounts of energy (2,260 kJ/kg), always occurring. We can accelerate the rate of water evaporation by spraying it as a droplet. The smaller the droplet, the greater the surface area to volume ratio becomes. Additionally, as the droplet settles, air flows over it, increasing the evaporation rate further.

A one-horsepower water pump (like this [one ](https://www.grainger.com/product/Submersible-Deep-Well-Pump-1LZR8)) can move 12 gallons per minute 100 feet at a pressure differential of 50 PSI. Assuming only half of the 12 gallons sprayed into the air evaporate (22.7 kg), it would still absorb 50 MJ of energy per minute. The energy inputted into the pump is only 44 kJ per minute22. By using evaporative cooling at 50% efficiency, it still magnifies the work done by the pump by over 100,000 %. This magnifies a 1,000 hp engine to a 1,000,000 hp engine.

This will cause the temperature of the surface of the ocean to decrease, humid air is less dense than dry air, causing the more humid air to form a low-pressure zone. As the humid air travels upwards, it cools and the water vapor begins to condense, causing the air to become hotter and more humid than the surrounding air. This will strengthen the low-pressure zone, and create a seed that can form a tropical depression.

Once the tropical depression forms, it will strengthen, further magnifying the work done by the pump, as it travels over the ocean. Because of this, we would need to ensure that the Tropic depression only travels a relatively short distance so they don’t become dangerous. Many coastal regions are arid and would greatly benefit from multiple tropical depressions throughout the year.

In addition to using this for generating rain, it could also be used to try to fight hurricanes. Hurricanes rely on warm water on the surface of the ocean to gain strength. If we were able to create tropical depressions, we could use them to fight hurricanes like we use controlled burns to fight forest fires.

Here's that quote:

""A typical tree can absorb around 21 kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, however this figure is only achieved when the tree is fully grown - saplings will absorb significantly less than this. Over a lifetime of 100 years, one tree could absorb around a tonne of CO2. While this seems like a significant amount, humans are creating about [40 billions tonnes of CO2](https://www.viessmann.co.uk/company/blog/the-carbon-footprint-of-nearly-everything) each year, meaning that we’d need to plant 40 billion trees annually to offset the emissions created.

""All of this makes the Bonaventure gannets ideal sentinels for the health of the marine ecosystem in the gulf. They form the world's second largest gannet colony and are easier to reach than the largest, on Scotland's remote Bass Island.
Quebec and global scientists say climate change is surely reshaping the lives of the northern gannets. Warmer sea temperatures drive their prey to cooler depths, distant waters or both.
But the full impact of climate change is not yet established and overfishing may be an even greater danger.
In tandem, the threats from fishing and warming force the gannets to go farther afield in search of food for their island chicks and themselves. The distance the birds fly on a single fishing trip has more than doubled in recent years to an average of 500 kilometres (300 miles), leaving one mate and the chick waiting several days or longer to be fed by the hunter, says Guillemette.
If the mate on the nest gets too weak from hunger, it may fly off for food, too, leaving the young one to starve or to wander from the nest and risk being killed by an adult. Like many seabirds, adult gannets may kill any intruders to their nesting areas.
Researchers have been able to draw a strong correlation between the supply of mackerel in the gulf and the number of chicks produced. In 2012, when there were almost no mackerel, only 4 per cent of the nests produced a chick, Guillemette said, a record low attributed to unusually warm waters that year.""",True,False,False,False

"As someone with money, but no time, how can I make the most meaningful impact on forest conservation?",9,ChimericGames,1695999901.0,32,0.81,16ve2yk,climatechange,False,"TL;DR: I am someone with money but no free time who wants to get involved in forest conservation. Please help me navigate which charities I can trust and how to make the biggest impact mitigating or repairing the effects of climate change.

Hi, Reddit. For a little background, I created a video game startup and against all odds it did quite well in early access. I do most of the work myself, and it's not finished yet, so the job is very demanding. Between working on the game, my toddler, and other obligations, I have very little free time, but I do have savings and investments. As a very eco-conscious person, I want to do something meaningful, but I'm facing paralysis on what actions to take.

I've tried to stay informed. I follow podcasts, Twitter accounts, and read books about climate change and conservation (recently I read ""Evergreen: Saving big forests to save the planet"" by John W. Reid and Thomas E. Lovejoy), but what I'm finding is that almost all of the advice out there on how to get involved is targeted at people who have time and no resources, or explains how to reduce your personal impact, or is focused on expressing that the threat is indeed very dire (of this I am aware). Making calls to government or getting involved locally isn't an option for me, and I have incredibly little faith that it would be meaningful if I did. I want to maximize my impact. But whenever I discuss charities with my family and friends, what is emphasized is that I ought to be incredibly careful which charities can be trusted, who will use the funds well, and to do my own research. I'm trying, but I could use your help.

I can't be sure I'll stay profitable at all, but my long term plan is to transition my games to some model that donates a % of sales to one or more charities, while also trying to boost awareness and maybe get involved with other game developers who are willing to do the same. If you know someone who might be interested to hear this, maybe put me in touch? In the mean time, I can just do donations.

I also see people suggesting that we should invest in green tech, but I'm super uncomfortable putting my money in the hands of some tech company who may or may not be on the right track, and whose word I have to trust at face value. I know that leaving land untouched and protected is one of the best things we can hope to do, so forest conservation charity makes sense to me and feels aligned with my values. But which ones are truly scientifically informed and altruistic? I know what's coming; I don't want to give up hard earned money only to find the forest I tried to protect is now a dust bowl in a few hundred years, or that someone else might have managed the money more responsibly.

Any direction, contacts, or help the community can provide is deeply appreciated. Thank you.

The waste heat effect,10,stisa79,1695921768.0,38,0.71,16ulxrt,climatechange,False,"This is perhaps controversial but I hope you hear me out. It is a genuine question. I believe in anthropogenic global warming, just to get that out of the way. The question is how we can know that this is primarily due to CO2 release and not waste heat? The effect each of these would have on global warming is quite complex, and I am not sure if anybody has been able to quantify the waste heat effect on the global temperature. So how can we know that this is almost negligible compared to the greenhouse effect, because that seems to be the assumption?

Since waste heat and CO2 are correlated, they also both correlate strongly with the global temperature. So it is not easy to separate the two merely by considering empirical data. But I have thought about a couple of things that speak in favor of the waste heat effect being more dominant compared to CO2 than we perhaps tend to think.

* The warming asymmetry that has been identified suggests that night temperatures and annual minimum temperatures increase more than day and annual maximum, respectively. I think this is better explained by increased heating than CO2.
* Global temperatures during WWII were significantly higher than the years before and after. It seems more than a coincidence. We know that was a time with a lot of combustion by ramped up production and military activity. Releasing CO2 in the atmosphere too of course, but that would not explain the cooling after WWII, so again waste heat seems a better explanation. 

I realize that I may be making some wrong assumptions along the way, and that there might be other evidence that is better explained by CO2 than waste heat. So if you know anything about this, please enlighten me.",True,False,False,False
I'm from South America and the situation is horrifying,1476,elpayande,1695821343.0,710,0.88,16tknic,climatechange,False,"So... As is known, most of the southern hemisphere has been suffering with the effects of a heat dome lately. In my city by the end of this winter we were already reaching temps as high as 25-30ºC. **Yes, in WINTER.** Our winters are never very cold but here we'd usually have like 10-15 ºC at this time of the year and temperatures above 30ºC are rare even in summer. Then spring started and this week we are reaching 34-38ºC. This is just the beginning of spring!

I feel like I'm going crazy because most people don't seem to be taking this as seriously as I am. Lots of news broadcasters seem to pin this on El Niño alone, like it's just a random wheather anomaly that could have happened at any point. On the streets people just complain about he heat as if it was just a hot summer (it's not even summer folks!!!), and on the internet I barely see people talk about what is (to me) a very early preview of the more devastating effects of climate change.

My mind doesn't work very well in the heat so uh, right now it feels like I might never see a cold weather again and it's horrifying. Probably overreacting because of heat stress, but still. Perhaps I was not keeping up with the news about climate change, but I thought it would take a few more years before we would see something like this.

I am in the midst of finishing and moving to a house in a rural area where I plan to grow my own food forest, but I'm scared that this heat and possible droughts or excessive rain will make it already very difficult. I expected at least a few years of peaceful gardening and good crops. If the upcoming summer is hotter than it is right now though, I don't see how everything isn't going to just fry in the sun.

TL/DR is... I'm terrified about this heat wave and have no idea what to do to better prepare for the coming years (including mentally). I would appreciate any input or suggestions from people who have been thinking and researching more about climate change than I am. I'm not sure if I want to be one of the many climate migrants (though if I am, I suppose it would be better to be an early one) but damn if this isn't scary.

ill start with a few:  

Here are some innovative solutions cited from the past 6 years that could help address the sustainability problems:

Bar-On et al. (2018) study on declining mammal biomass:

- Cultured meat production techniques: Novel cell culture and tissue engineering methods are being developed to produce meat without raising and slaughtering livestock, helping mitigate land use impacts. (Post, 2012)

- Insect farming for animal feed: Emerging technologies enable sustainable breeding of insects like black soldier flies that can provide high-quality feed supplement for livestock, reducing agricultural land needs. (Veldkamp et al., 2012)


Newbold et al. (2020) study on future food production impacts:  

- Precision fermentation of proteins: Companies are using precision fermentation to produce protein-rich foods like cultured dairy without the land use footprint of livestock. (Perfect Day, 2016) 

- Indoor vertical farming: Controlled environment agriculture using minimal land and resources indoors is being scaled up for urban locations near populations. (AeroFarms, 2017)


Jambeck et al. (2015) study on ocean plastic pollution:

- Plastic waste pyrolysis: Thermal and chemical recycling technologies can convert mixed plastic waste into fuels and waxes, preventing plastic leakage. (Agilyx, 2016)

- Biodegradable plastic alternatives: Many startups are developing sustainable bioplastics derived from agricultural residues or microbes that can degrade in ocean environments. (Bio circulating, 2018)

----------

Here are 5 innovations/discoveries from the past 3 years that are helping to address the issue of global warming:

1. Direct air capture technology - In 2021, Climeworks opened the world's largest direct air capture plant in Iceland that captures CO2 directly from the air. This provides a way to actively remove CO2 already in the atmosphere. (Climeworks, 2021)

2. Lower-cost solar panels - Significant improvements in solar panel efficiency and manufacturing have driven costs down around 89% in the last decade. This is helping solar become one of the cheapest sources of new electricity. (IRENA, 2021) 

3. Low-carbon building materials - Companies are developing innovative building materials like low-carbon concrete and mass timber that can significantly reduce embodied carbon in construction. (Materials startup Anthropic raises $55M, 2021)

4. Green hydrogen production - Technologies for producing hydrogen via renewable energy instead of fossil fuels are advancing. This could enable decarbonization of hard-to-electrify sectors like shipping and heavy industry. (Sandia engineers make big renewable hydrogen leap, 2021)

"How does water vapor and CO2 interact in our warming climate? Often the two are confused, with an argument made that water vapor is the culprit.",20,Dylan0110,1695563192.0,422,0.76,16qy5bm,climatechange,False,"Below are useful references that shed more light on this topic. 

Columbia University 

https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/07/30/co2-drives-global-warming/#:~:text=CO2%20makes%20up%20only%20about,to%20escape%20without%20being%20absorbed.
""CO2 makes up only about 0.04% of the atmosphere, and water vapor can vary from 0 to 4%. But while water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas in our atmosphere, it has “windows” that allow some of the infrared energy to escape without being absorbed. In addition, water vapor is concentrated lower in the atmosphere, whereas CO2 mixes well all the way to about 50 kilometers up. The higher the greenhouse gas, the more effective it is at trapping heat from the Earth’s surface.

Both water vapor and CO2 are responsible for global warming, and once we increase the CO2 in the atmosphere, the oceans warm up, which inevitably triggers an increase in water vapor. But while we have no way to control water vapor, we can control CO2. And because we are increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by continuing to burn fossil fuels, even in relatively small amounts compared to the entire mass of the atmosphere, we are disturbing the entire heat balance of the planet.""

World Meteorological Org -https://public.wmo.int/en/resources/bulletin/observing-water-vapour

""Some atmospheric gases, such as water vapour and CO2, absorb and re-emit infrared energy from the atmosphere down to the Earth’s surface. This process, the greenhouse effect, leads to a mean surface temperature that is 33 °C greater than it would be in its absence. If it were not for the greenhouse gas effect, Earth’s average temperature would be a chilly -18 °C. However, it is the non-condensable or long-lived greenhouse gases – mainly CO2, but also methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and halocarbons (CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs) – that act as the drivers of the greenhouse effect. Water vapour and clouds act as fast feedbacks – that is to say that water vapour responds rapidly to changes in temperature, through evaporation, condensation and precipitation.

This strong water vapour feedback means that for a scenario considering a doubling of the CO2 concentration from pre-industrial conditions, water vapour and clouds globally lead to an increase in thermal energy that is about three times that of the long-lived greenhouse gases. Therefore, measured in the ability to trap the heat emanating from the Earth’s surface, water vapour and clouds are the largest contributors to warming. The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is a direct response to the amount of CO2 and the other long-lived greenhouse gases, increasing as they do.

It is impossible for us to control directly the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere since water is found everywhere on our planet – it covers 71% of Earth’s surface. To limit the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere and control Earth’s temperature, we must limit the greenhouse gases that we can, in practice, do something about: CO2 and the other long-lived greenhouse gases.""

Edit: since this has got quite a few responses, it seems that extinction is used by many people to mean the same as “human society collapsing”, or just really really bad for humans, and that I might be using the word too literally. For those people arguing that CC has potential to be really really bad for us - I agree with you 100%. Also, my apologies if I was a bit curt in some responses, like “that’s not extinction”, or something like that. Wasn’t trying to be rude.

There are also some people who do mean it in the literal sense.

Artificial Superintelligence and the Climate Crisis,3,ReadSeparate,1695497834.0,93,0.54,16qd76o,climatechange,False,"Hello, I wanted to get some people's opinions on this issue. As most/all of you know, artificial intelligence as a field has been developing rapidly. Alongside that, climate change is likely to cause extremely dire problems for human civilization if we don't make major changes in energy, behaviors, and resource usage. 

Climate change used to worry me more than anything in the world aside from nuclear apocalypse. Now, it's barely on my mind. 

Why? Because of AI. AI has advanced at a rapid pace, and 90% of AI experts believe that we will achieve human level AI by 2075: https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/

This is a relatively conservative estimate, and the timelines seem to be moving closer and closer. 

In fact, OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT and one of the world's leading organizations in AI, believes that Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), which is AI which **exceeds** human level intelligence, might arrive **this decade**: https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment#fn-A

There's no telling how high the ceiling is on intelligence, though we know for at least some domains it's possible to be superior to human minds in both speed and abilities (think how the best chess player in the world is a computer, or the fastest calculator in the world is a computer). It may be the case that one day, the smartest being on Earth will be millions of times smarter than the human race combined - a God in a box so to speak.

If we are able to build minds that exceed our own before the century is over, then surely they will have the ability to solve the climate crisis.

As we know, it's physically possible to solve climate change, after all, we caused it in the first place with our physical and chemical actions.

This has pretty much completely replaced my fear of climate change with a new fear of AI. 

If we build superhuman AI before the climate change crisis hits its peak, which seems likely at this point, then one of two things will happen:

1. If the AI is aligned with human interests, it will solve this issue, along with many/all others, for us with new technologies
2. If the AI is not aligned with human interests, we have a way bigger problem on our hands and it can just kill us all anyway 

What do you all think of this? I think it's very reasonable and placed in pretty grounded trends and science, however, it's completely possible that, for some reason, it takes us way longer than expected to build ASI, and thus the climate apocalypse gets to us first. That seems very unlikely, but it seems like the only option in which we get screwed by climate change. The probability of superhuman intelligence NOT being able to solve climate change seems so low that it's almost not even worth considering.

Does anyone have any arguments against this? I haven't heard/thought of any that I haven't accounted for here (mainly being what if we're too late in building ASI)",True,False,False,False

How many people lived back in 1800? 1 billion people, good, what was the average co2 footprint for each? Not many details are available, but the estimate is .05 tons per year.

Ok, so back in year 1800 the entire population co2 footprint was 50 million tons. so, everything after 50 million tons is hey, you are on your own.

Ok, but Earth triggered tons of temporary processes that have evolved over billions of years to help with the issue, including the ocean absorption of CO2, which is all helping us a lot, but these temporary processes will have some limits eventually.

🤔 Confused about global temperature increase & climate change,56,talk-to-peter,1695323995.0,314,0.86,16oon4p,climatechange,False,"I was recently at a local museum on west coast BC, Canada that had a board on glaciation on the region, Gabriola Island. There was a graph indicating 'The Earth has been getting progressively colder over the last 50 million years' showing the relative temperature fluctuations. There is a zoom in of the current interglacial period.

Images: [https://imgur.com/a/ZAitJaw](https://imgur.com/a/ZAitJaw)

Can someone who understands the science explain to me, within the context of the current climate change crisis, how our relative global temperature increase deviates from past glacial events?

For example, climate scientists say that a 1.5-3° average temp increase is catastrophic to global systems. But on this graph, it shows over the past 500,000 years fluctuations of +6°C to -3°C as normal. Our current period is totally in line with the last 4 periods.

Further, it shows global temperatures cooling (Global temperature variations over the past  50 million years) from a relative temperature  that was 14°C higher than current temperatures!

So how does the science work in all of this? Is this just a human crisis and not a planetary crisis, meaning it's catastrophic to humans if the temperature rises 3°? Like if the sea levels rise 200' its catastrophic to us but pretty normal for the planet?

As a lay person I don't understand.

UPDATE

As others have pointed out, it's the current short term rate of temperature increase that is catastrophic to humans, not that the earth can't support a temperature increase.

Converting to solar and wind is actually going to improve your life because it's at minimum a 14% return on investment (if you do it yourself), and it increases air quality, and makes you more independent.  Taxing pollution like gas and oil and non-recyclable packaging and using those taxes to implement solutions for things like reforestation, wildlife refuge preservation, trash cleanup, community gardens, education, and recycling centers isn't going to grind society to a halt - it's going to increase the quality of life for people.

Climate Change and Its Impact on Coastal Cities: What Can We Do?,8,OutrageousPay7510,1694875166.0,165,0.62,16k95nn,climatechange,False,"
Hey fellow Redditors,

I wanted to start a discussion about the pressing issue of climate change and its effects on coastal cities around the world. With rising sea levels and extreme weather events becoming more frequent, it’s crucial that we talk about this and brainstorm potential solutions.

Here are a few questions to kick things off:

	1.	How has climate change already affected your local coastal area?
	2.	What initiatives or policies are being implemented in your region to address these challenges?
	3.	What can individuals do to mitigate the impact of climate change on coastal cities?
	4.	Are there any innovative technologies or projects you’ve come across that offer hope for the future?

Let’s use this thread to share information, experiences, and ideas on how we can collectively tackle this global issue. Remember to be respectful and open-minded in your discussions.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 🌍🌊",True,False,False,False

RANT 

Asking for other petrol heads in the same position..
My feed is either filled with posts about all the climate change related flooding that is happening or extreme weather events caused this week. Or the coral reefs in the keys that have bleached this summer.

I love riding my bike but since getting my driving license and injuring my back rarely do so for commuting purposes. 
I rarely ever use the shitty public transport to travel anywhere especially for surf trips. 

I also see posts from the car community hating on EVs. Yes its funny and yes I agree they are not as fun to drive as a petrol car. They have no personality and are very limited in terms of modifications. They also in my opinion are not really an effective solution to climate change, instead just a somewhat temporary solution to a more deep rooted problem. 

I also see the comments section of people outright denying climate change within the car/ general community, which is slightly concerning. I feel like most people have an incredibly limited idea of what is actually happening. 

 I can't really support either side but feel somewhat guilty not doing my part for climate change. That being said all the cars I have driven are so much more economical compared to their American counterparts. And my dad is a great mechanic who has kept our cars going. 

But yeah it feels like a rant. I either enjoy the freedoms of my 20s and feel guilty that the planet is burning or don't travel and feel shitty that I'm wasting my youth.
I'd vote for the green party but feel like they are too extreme to secure a place, and all the other parties are happy to sit around and do fuck all. 
 
Maybe I'm waiting for the glimmer of hope that synthetic petroleum can keep car enthusiasts going whilst most people switch to electric.

Misinformation by climate skeptics that keeps being posted over and over. This post presents a counter argument to the claims,243,Tpaine63,1694737997.0,248,0.84,16iytcz,climatechange,False,"  

[This](https://co2coalition.org/news/two-princeton-mit-scientists-say-epa-climate-regulations-based-on-a-hoax/) article has been posted 5 times very recently which contains a lot of mis-information. The mis-information has been pointed out but the article continues to appear as if there is no problem. This post is a total summary of the problems with this article.

Not a part of the article but it is often stated these are two eminent scientist. But that is argument by authority since it’s the facts, not the credentials of the author that matter. The definition of eminent is “respected within a particular sphere or profession.”. Neither are respected by their peers within the field of climate science.

The comment on the first graph states “Climate models like the ones that the EPA is using have been consistently wrong for decades in predicting actual outcomes, Mr. Happer told The Epoch Times. The graph shows the deviation between the actual temperatures and the measured temperatures over 40,000 feet above the surface of the planet. Although the article is dated this year, the data is fairly dated. [Here](https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2023/03/some-new-cmip6-msu-comparisons/#ITEM-24767-0) is a more recent examination with updated data. And [here](https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2021/01/update-day-2021/) is an article showing how surface models have projected compared to actual measurements updated to 2021. Since the surface of the planet is where most of life lives, that is what would seem important to humans.

The next graph shows CO2 levels with global temperature levels for the life of the planet. The intent is to show that CO2 levels do not correlate with temperatures. However the sun’s radiation has increased 30% over the life of the planet. So the temperature of the earth should be adjusted to account for the lower radiation from the sun billions of years ago. The global temperatures certainly do not follow the sun’s radiation over billions of years. [Here](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Temperature-change-over-the-past-400-000-years-correlate-closely-with-variations-in_fig1_308983884) is a graph of CO2 vs global temperatures over the past 200k years when the sun’s radiation has changed very little and it shows a close correlation. 

The next graph that shows synthetic fertilizers does nothing to show the climate models are wrong.

The next graph that shows population increase and also does nothing to show the climate models are wrong.

The next graph that shows the additional CO2 effect does not increase in proportion to the amount of CO2 added. But this is well known by scientists and is included in the models so it does nothing to show the climate models are wrong.

The next graph that shows an increasing ratio of daily record high-to-low temperatures to indicate rising global temperatures. Then he makes the comment 

*“This chart does not actually show ‘daily temperatures,’” they state. “Instead it show a ‘ratio’ of daily record highs to lows – a number that appears designed to create the impression that temperatures are steadily rising.”*

He then gives no reason it does not show rising temperature and I don’t think any scientist doesn’t accept that global temperatures are rising. But more to the point he uses the next graph of “heat Wave Index” to try and show temperatures were higher in the 1930s than they are today. Somewhat unbelievably that chart also doesn’t show temperatures which is exactly what he criticizes the EPA of being deceitful about. I have never seen any graph that shows global or US temperatures in the 1930s to be higher than today. And it does nothing to show the climate models are wrong.

He then goes on a little talk about consensus of scientists doesn’t determine science and ends up with this statement:

*“Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world,” Dr. Crichton said. “In science, consensus is irrelevant. What are relevant are reproducible results.”* 

But he fails to present any scientific research that can produce any reproducible results contradicts what climate scientist are saying about climate change. 

Then this statement:

*“The initial predictions of climate disasters had New York flooded by now, no ice left at the North Pole, England would be like Siberia by now,”* 

But never gives who or where this prediction was made.

He then goes into some quotes about how anyone who dissents is not invited to speak at meetings. Pretty much like flat earthers are also not invited to speak at meetings. Neither of which has anything to do with climate science.

And then more whining about thousands of climate scientist all over the world in every country are deceiving the public for some reason. Also has nothing to do with climate science.

A climate scientist wanted to start a debate in academia. He set off a bigger firestorm,25,CRTsdidnothingwrong,1694527031.0,32,0.77,16gs2tq,climatechange,False,,False,False,False,False
I'm very disturbed by the number of people who support climate engineering,371,bananas1224,1694470873.0,360,0.88,16g9ehy,climatechange,False,"It's really not a good idea. 

I'm going to list a few points that form the basis of my opinion that it's really not a good idea.

1. Carbon dioxide emissions aren't just warming the planet. They are also making the ocean more acidic. Oceans uptake CO2. This lowers the pH of the ocean in a process called ocean acidification. If we keep emitting CO2, even with a perfect geoengineering scheme that offsets CO2 warming perfectly (unlikely), the oceans will still become more acidic. This is a global threat to ocean life. We need to stop emitting CO2 for that reason alone. 

2. The Earth is warming nonuniformly. The Arctic is warming 2-3x faster than the rest of the planet, termed Arctic amplification. Any geoengineering scheme must offset not only the global mean rise in temperature but also the pattern of warming. Some studies suggest that injecting aerosol in the  stratosphere may not offset Arctic amplification. This means that even if the global mean temperature is held fixed, the Arctic temperature may continue to rise. This could still lead to sea level rise. 

3. Unintended consequences. As a climate scientist, I can tell you this: we don't understand everything about climate change. Not even close, and I'm not trying to make us look bad. It's just a fact most people outside of academia don't realize. An example is climate sensitivity. A basic question, ""how much does the temperature rise when doubling CO2?"" varies by between 2 and 8 K in models participating CMIP6. This enormous spread has gotten bigger despite our best efforts to constrain climate models. Along these lines, it's worth noting that you can change extremely esoteric parameters in climate model, like convective entrainment rate, and change the climate sensitivity tremendously. And we don't know why. Now, knowing this, do you really feel comfortable injecting Aerosol into the stratosphere when the only source of knowledge we have on the impacts this would have come from models? Models that can't agree on climate sensitivity for reasons we don't understand, despite decades of research? Let me be clear: we know CO2 is warming the planet and we know why. But there are tons of things we don't understand. Another example is the hydrological cycle. We don't have a full grasp of how/why precipitation will change from raising CO2. There are papers about it constantly. So, we certainly don't know what would happen to the hydrological cycle if we add Aerosol to the stratosphere. The fact is this: the consequence of injecting Aerosol in the stratosphere has a non negligible chance of making things worse. I don't have enough trust in climate models to make decisions about geoengineering based on their predictions, and this is coming from someone who works at lab developing climate models.

4. Frankly, the studies on climate engineering are not great and still in their infancy. Many studies on injecting Aerosol in the stratosphere model it stupendously crudely: they simply reduce the solar constant in a climate model by an amount that they assume Aerosols would dim sunlight. The reality is, injecting Aerosol in the stratosphere wouldn't be as simple as reducing the solar constant by a uniform amount globally. Aerosol can move. Aersol can interact with longwave radiation as well as shortwave. People of course know this, but modeling the physics precisely is a challenge that is still being incorporated into studies.

5. While I'm not an expert outside of the science side of things, I can't help but think about the international effort required to accomplish climate engineering. It would require international cooperation, tremendous technological advances, and money. A question: is it really easier to stop climate change by using engineering rather than using more sustainable infrastructure? To me, both climate engineering and developing sustainable infrastructure face the same difficult hurdles mentioned earlier: international cooperation, technological advances, money. So to me, it's not clear why climate engineering would be an easier way to solve the problem. Perhaps some people on this thread think it's necessary to work on both climate engineering and reducing CO2. Another question: would the resources spent on climate engineering be better spent on developing sustainable infrastructure? (I think you know my opinion on this).

Final thoughts: 
1. I want to mention something also many people on this thread probably don't realize. Most climate scientists oppose implementation of climate engineering. I work at a lab that employs _many_ climate scientists. Nobody here thinks it's a good idea. Even people studying climate engineering at my lab don't support it's use. 
2. This is far from an exhaustive list of drawbacks. 
3. I focused on Aerosol injection in the stratosphere, but other geoengineering schemes, such as cloud brightening, have been proposed. These face similar problems. 
4. I support further study of geoengineering. A model Intercomparison Project for it exists and is called GeoMIP. Note even GeoMIP acknowledges the potential for dangerous consequences associated with geoengineering. See: http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/geomip/

Edit: also wanted to mention that the only intervention I do support direct air capture. This is because zero emissions doesn't reverse global warming. We need direct air capture to cool the planet. See: https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/blog_held/23-cumulative-emissions/

Edit 2: It seems from the comments I have a bit to learn about DAC and the different methods of drawing down CO2. I'm not informed on the drawbacks DAC vs other methods.

\-I’ve fallen in love and married a girl from Western Australia.

\-We are going to more from New Zealand to WA to live. My wife wants to live permanently in WA. I want to settle in NZ. There are many reasons why I want to be in NZ and among them is my belief that most of NZ (not all) will fare better than likely anywhere in WA in terms of future habitation. For the most part right now this is just my belief. I have not found documentation which makes it plain that this belief is correct.

\-We both agree that we would like to purchase land affordable to us and to work towards greater personal sufficiency for our family. Thinking particularly fruit and nut trees, growing vegetables, chickens, sheep etc. Climate change, resource depletion etc very much in consideration with this.

\-Looking at average rainfall and tempretures, the coastal southern region of WA appears to fare much better than other parts of the state (lower tempretures, higher rainfall). I understand that broadly though, WA is expecting to become dryer and hotter, and it already seems hot and dry to me..

\-NZ has had it’s share of weather events in recent years, particularly with several disastourous rain events in 2023, but my belief is that even in spite of this NZ broadly seems to be the better place to be for ongoing habitation – Better soil and climate for growing things. Many parts of the country appear better positioned than other places for the changing times. I acknowledge though that my main draw to NZ is an emotional one.

If you could choose to live in WA or NZ which would you choose, or is their no  difference???

Hot Take: Climate Change itself is one giant feedback loop.,27,Befuddled_fish,1694160796.0,37,0.8,16d4lh1,climatechange,False,"So I’m sitting here thinking.. As extreme weather events exponentially increase across the globe, thus increases the damage to infrastructure and property. In the majority of cases, the damage will be replaced or rebuilt (devastatingly, some individuals or areas will not be able to afford to do this - losing everything). This rebuilding and replacing process uses a lot of resources and embodied Carbon that goes into the process of replacing or rebuilding. Therefore, increasing green house gas emissions, which in turn will worsen the climate emergency.

I’m sat here mulling over the vast quantities of items, infrastructure, property, vehicles etc that will be replaced in the coming years. It’s in our nature to rebuild and replace.. to grow and not recede. 

Are there articles and studies on this already? (I went straight to reddit, rather than google)

Have models taken into account the increased CO2 emissions of the embodied Carbon that goes into replacing damaged infrastructure and property? Because I don’t see a way of calculating or predicting such data. 

For some context: I am a carpenter in Australia, currently renovating a damaged property from the record breaking and biblical floods that happened in Feb 2022. The town was devastated - the residential property I’m working on the waters were up to head height on the First floor. The entire town needed renovating, cars replaced, bridges made safe, new drainage, roads resurfaced, all personal property replaced.. the list goes on. This town had similar, yet ever so slightly smaller serious floods like this in 1954, 74 and 2017. With numerous other occasions over the towns history the levees being broken and damage happening.
The town is guaranteed to flood again (probably the next La Niña) - the months of work, travel and vast quantities of materials going into this one house must have quite the Carbon Footprint.. and this will be ruined and destroyed at the next flood. This cycle must be playing itself out all over the globe, or if it’s not the same town being rebuilt it’s the one next door.

Many people think that a lot of the difficulty of dealing with climate change (in terms of mitigating and preventing it, rather than merely reacting to weather events) involves communication, both of the science and of the gravity of the real-world results and urgent need for seemingly outrageous modification of our collective behavior. I think an important step in this direction would be to eradicate the familiar nomenclature of storm severity and replace it with something more meaningful in real-world terms, something more useful in both reacting to weather events and comprehending the scale and scope of the underlying problem of AGW.

The conventional ""category"" system (the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind scale) was developed by meteorologists and is based on a storm's maximums sustained wind speed. While this is a useful measure of potential damage to residential infrastructure, it is both banal and inaccurate, in real terms. It is so dated it borders on archaic, and not nearly precise enough to mean anything more than that a hurricane will be ""really big"" in practical terms. It doesn't take into account that so-called ""hundred year storms"" are now occuring more than once a decade. And the Fujita Tornado Damage scale has essentially the same problem. Both seemed like good ideas in times past, focusing as they do on the potential impact on individual houses, but neither takes into account the even more important issues of how widespread the damage will be, and how much ancillary catastrophe (from flooding, damage to infrastructure rather than individual buildings, and similar issues) results from a truly huge storm. Both ""top out"" at a conventional level of ""the worst that (used to be) normally possible and anything even worse than that"".

So here's my suggestion. I believe we (meaning they, the people who deal with such things professionally, particularly NOAA and perhaps the IPCC) should develop a new approach to reporting the potential severity and impact of hurricanes, typhoons, tornados, etc. It should work like this: develop a formula (the details are largely irrelevant, so long as it is the same formula for all events of a given type) that takes into account direct effects, such as wind damage and rainfall, as well as resulting devastation (damage to infrastructure, including houses, utilities, industry, and transportation, and lasting impact on the environment) and also *real effect* (death, injury, and dislocation of human beings). Rank the most severe storms in our scientific record using this formula (this 'ranking' approach is why the details of the formula are irrelevant) and identify the worst ten, or worst hundred, such weather events. Then, when a new weather event is threatening to cause drastic affects on people's lives, identify the storm publicly as ""level 10"" (for example: equivalent to the tenth worst event of that type) or ""level 1"" (equal to the worst such storm), including, when applicable, by name. To hear that there is a ""Category 5 hurricane approaching"" is simply abstract information, causing grave distress to the people who are most worried but not most concerned, and being ignored as just another news alert by everyone else. But to hear that there is ""a level 1 hurricane, comparable to Katrina"", and be told that this isn't just ""wind speed"", but how many thousands of people could well be killed, how many tens of thousands may become homeless, how many billions of dollars it could take to even begin to recover, and have real scientific validity (because while it may be based on projections, these will be measurable projections comparable to more than mere meteorology), might be more than worth the effort. Not just in terms of how people will react to that specific event, but how much they recognize that ***things are not going to start getting better, every year will be worse (on average) than the last, and there is no end in sight until we start making serious efforts to not just limit how much carbon we are sending into the atmosphere with fossil fuels but removing the excess we've already ""desequestered""***. 

I think that ""level 1"" will not be enough, of course, since things will indeed keep getting worse, with ""hundred year storms"" happening more and more frequently, and all storms being just a bit more powerful than they would have been without AGW. We don't want this new ""level"" scale to suffer the same problem that the ""category"" one did, topping out at a ""this or higher"" metric. We should have a 1+ level to indicate a valid expert concensus (from meteorologists, climatologists and other biospheric researchers, and emergency management professionals) that the coming storm may well be worse than any we have seen before. And on top of that, a 1++ level, to identify that this coming catastrophe could be up to *twice* as bad as the worst we've had to deal with, and even a 1+++ to mean that it is expected to be up to three times as bad.

Obviously, the precision of the immediate identification and the reliance on projected damage will be less than what we can produce with the current scales, but as I have already mentioned, the current scales aren't very precise in human terms to begin with. A ""Category 5"" that only hits relatively uninhabited regions is still a ""Category 5"", and only takes wind speed into account to begin with. We need something more practical, and the varience that multiple groups of experts, or individual experts, might have about any particular event will not result in less concern and discussion but more, and provide valuable information that people can intelligently use to learn who knows the most and has the best ability to project these things on an ongoing basis. What is more, the ""scale"" will automatically adjust *without losing efficacy* as it will always be constantly re-assessed against the ten (or hundred) worst storms that have already occured, rather than just an abstract (and not nearly as certain as we pretend) and unchanging equivalency between wind speed and damage to houses and telephone poles.

Obviously, this would require tremendously more work and study than simply maintaining the (insufficient) status quo. And that right there is a prime reason for doing it. We need to do better and we need to do more, all of us, both the experts and the relatively passive audience hearing the proclamations of those experts alike.

Climate change is not an existential threat. The climate of the earth is in perpetual flux. Perhaps humans are affecting it, perhaps not.

In a free market, eventually the best technologies will win. If you want to drive an EV, have at it, but there are better solutions on the horizon. Hydrogen power, given time and a fair shot in a free market would win out over battery technology.

Airplanes will never, ever, be battery powered, nor will the massive mining equipment or slave labor that digs up the metals needed to make them.

Maybe I'm way off here but an avarage increase of 1.5°c is 10% up on 15°c, and the level of evaporation, higher saturation points, more water vapour suspended for same high relative humidity.. it's a recipe for electrical storms, heavy downpours, hurricanes etc. 

So why does the UN and everyone else keep saying we're 1.5° above pre-industrial temps? Not that it's incorrect, but it just sounds like such a small number, like they're understating the seriousness of it and what it means in real terms. 

If they said that the lower atmospheres capacity to hold water vapour has increased by X%, that the frequency and amount of rainfall will increase by X% would it not be more accurate? Would it encourage people to be more environmentally aware when purchasing/consuming.

As these climate events happen the increased moisture in the atmosphere will trap even more heat leading to even more evaporation leading to heavier more sustained rainfall.

Aka are we bound to experience serious climate related events no matter what we do? Any reduction in demand of fossil fuels will lower their prices, making fossil fuels extremely attractive to poorer nations. So I worry that no matter what cuts are made, around 40-50% of the world will not pursue any serious emissions reductions at all.  

And if serious warming will occur, wouldn’t it be better to spend our money preparing for those climate events by shoring up our infrastructure rather than tackling a problem that’s inevitable?

Every Skeptics Argument on Climate Change and the science to disprove it,69,futurecomputer3000,1693512520.0,85,0.89,166lizu,climatechange,False,"Please  note that the arguments below lack strong scientific support and  have  been widely debunked by the scientific community. The prevailing   scientific consensus strongly indicates that human activities, including   fossil fuel burning like oil, significantly drive climate change. This   is extensively supported by global climate scientists.

Also,  Let's not forget Internal documents from ExxonMobil came to light,  revealing that the  company had information about climate change as  early as the 1970s even though they funded misinfo like seen below.  That's only one example , but i will save that for another post.

**Each Falsehood debunked**

1. **Natural Climate Variability**:  Some argue that the Earth's climate has undergone natural fluctuations  throughout its history, including periods of warming and cooling, long  before human industrial activity. While it's true that natural  variability exists, the rapid and unprecedented increase in greenhouse  gas concentrations since the industrial revolution aligns closely with  the observed rise in global temperatures.
2. **Solar Activity**:  Skeptics sometimes point to variations in solar radiation as a  potential driver of recent climate change. However, scientific research  has shown that solar activity has not increased significantly in recent  decades, and its contribution to the observed temperature rise is  minimal compared to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions.
3. **Urban Heat Island Effect**:  Skeptics might claim that urbanization and the heat generated by cities  are responsible for the observed warming, rather than greenhouse gas  emissions. While urban heat islands can influence local temperatures,  they are not the primary driver of global temperature trends, and  climate models take their effects into account.
4. **Incomplete Historical Data**:  Some skeptics argue that the historical temperature data is incomplete  or unreliable, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions about  human-caused climate change. However, extensive efforts have been made  to address data quality issues, and multiple independent datasets  corroborate the warming trend.
5. **Natural Carbon Emissions**:  Certain individuals may suggest that natural sources of carbon dioxide,  such as volcanic activity, release far more greenhouse gases than human  activities. While volcanic emissions are significant, they are much  smaller than human-caused emissions and do not explain the recent rapid  increase in carbon dioxide levels.
6. **Climate Models' Limitations**:  Skeptics often highlight the uncertainties associated with climate  models to cast doubt on the accuracy of their predictions. While models  have uncertainties, they have consistently projected the observed  warming when accounting for a range of factors, including human  emissions.

The  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and numerous scientific  organizations worldwide have concluded that human activities,  especially the burning of fossil fuels, are the primary drivers of the  rapid and unprecedented changes in the Earth's climate. Addressing  climate change is a global challenge that requires collective efforts to  transition to more sustainable energy sources and mitigate its impacts.

**But wait, Co2 is good for plants, right?**

Elevated  CO2 levels from human activities potentially benefiting plants  oversimplify complex ecosystem interactions and disregard negative  outcomes:

* **Diminishing Returns**: Initial benefits decline as other factors like nutrients, water, and temperature limit plant growth.
* **Imbalance in Ecosystems**: Rapid CO2 increases disrupt species balance, altering ecosystems and stability.
* **Nutritional Impact**: CO2 alters plant nutrition, affecting herbivores and omnivores that rely on them.
* **Heat Stress**: CO2-related temperature increases harm plants, negating positive effects.
* **Ocean Acidification**: Excess CO2 causes ocean acidification, threatening marine ecosystems.
* **Extreme Weather**: CO2-driven climate change intensifies hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, impacting plant life.
* **Pollination Disruption**: Climate change disrupts pollination, hurting plant reproduction and crops.
* **Biodiversity Loss**: CO2-linked disruptions lead to habitat loss, jeopardizing biodiversity.
* **Long-Term Consequences**: Unchecked CO2 emissions risk ecosystems, biodiversity, and human well-being.

From the Comments: ""**Greenland melted 400,000 years ago and had nothing to do with CO2""**

Certainly, let's address your concerns and provide some insights on why climate change is a real and pressing issue:

1. **Greenland's Historical Melting**: The natural climate variability that caused Greenland's melting 400,000 years ago isn't mutually exclusive with our current understanding of climate change. Today's situation involves a combination of factors, with human-caused greenhouse gas emissions being a significant contributor. CO2 levels have varied in the past, but the rapid increase since the industrial revolution is driving current changes.
2. **Ice Core Data and Boreholes**: Science is an evolving field, and advancements like the correction in the ice core method showcase its self-correcting nature. The consensus remains that human activities are causing current climate changes. Borehole measurements complement existing data, adding to our understanding of past climates.
3. **Climate Models and Predictions**: While there are various climate models, they consistently show warming trends linked to increased CO2 levels. NOTE: Media using RCP 8.5 might highlight a worst-case scenario to emphasize the urgent need for action. The broader consensus across models supports the reality of climate change.
4. **IPCC and Future Projections**: The IPCC's projections provide a range to account for uncertainties. While error margins exist, the consistent trend of warming and its impacts on ecosystems and species cannot be ignored. Making informed decisions based on the best available data remains crucial for our future well-being.

From the comments: ""**Less CO2 in the air means so much oxygen that we will die!** ""

While climate change and oxygen levels are separate issues, it's  important to clarify that the current atmospheric oxygen level is not a  concern for human health. Earth's atmosphere is primarily composed of  nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), along with trace amounts of  other gases.",True,False,False,False

I've noticed that in the past 30-40 years, hourly measured air temperature consistently rose faster than night temperatures. The graph is from Frankfurt in Germany and I checked several other weather stations all over Germany, of which all show the same pattern: The average growth rate of temperatures is 40% higher during the day than during the night.

Is there an explanation for that? 

I would expect that if the composition of the atmosphere was responsible for the warming of the climate, then the temperatures during the day and night should be rising in a much more parallel manner. This way, it would make much more sense to blame the sun on at least 40% of the temperature increase.

In advance, thank you very much.

Is climate change driving the war in Ukraine?,0,Tliish,1693588416.0,20,0.35,167d0v0,climatechange,False," 

Siberia is melting. Could that be what is driving Russia's war on Ukraine?

Climate change is effecting Russia more strongly than other countries because more of Russia is in the permafrost zone. Reports going back to 2005 have discussed the melt, and how it has been effecting the infrastructure across millions of square miles as the ground becomes increasingly unstable. Roads, pipelines, airfields, etc. are being rendered unusable because of it. Wildfires akin to what have been plaguing Canada this year have been burning in Russia for the past several years.

Could that be what is really driving Russia to continue a war that seems to offer no chance of worthwhile success? As climate change progresses, more and more of Russia is becoming less and less habitable and productive due to the melt.

I'm not saying it is the sole factor driving this war, but if the Russian government sees an inevitable loss of productivity across vast stretches of its territory it would explain a lot of why they continue to pursue it. It also would mean that they can't stop or give up the drive for territory, if not in Ukraine then elsewhere. I'm not sure that people have looked at this war in the context of climate change, most views seem to encompass only political and narrow economic reasons for it.

I’m a 39 year old business owner, married with two young girls and live a pretty good life in sweltering Dallas TX.  I think daily about climate change and where I want my family to be in the short & long term. I believe climate migration may be a slow trickle over the next decade or two (hard to say when half the population don’t believe in climate change) I’d like to be ahead of the curve and lay the ground work on my plans (buy a home? find land and build? Build a community?).  I know a lot of people here are probably have similar thoughts of wanting to get out of where they are so they aren’t affected by wild fires, water/draught issues, insane heat, hurricanes, etc. Almost all my friends and family feel the same but are stuck in a “I’m not sure where to begin or what to consider” headspace. I’d like to provide some thought out ideas. 

Which is why I’m here, looking for like-minded people to initiate meaningful discussion and action on climate migration. I have done some research and would like to share what I have and get other people’s unique ideas, insights and perspectives and discuss things starting with Optimal Relocation Sites  
 More specifically -  Based on available evidence, where are the best locations to consider for climate migration? Which areas are likely to be least threatened by the effects of climate change over the coming years? Are there essential infrastructure and services nearby? Is the area prepared for a potential influx of people in the short and long term? Things to consider for long term sustainability?  (BTW shout out to The Reliance School who is on this sub. He has great free climate risk maps/information on his site (reliance.school)

Their conclusion is that the high elevation of most of Antarctic land (ex. 11,000 ft plateau at South Pole) blocks the flow of humid air which is said to flow stronger to the North Pole due to climate change (added to fit data?).  Interesting that they make no mention of the feedback effect of melting sea ice exposing more dark ocean to absorb the sun's rays, which is said to account for 30% of the warming in the Arctic.  Antarctica is surrounded by a large area of sea ice, so wonder why not also significant there.  Their modeling shows that if Antarctic ice was at sea level, like at the North Pole, the warming from increased humid air flow would only increase Winter temperatures rather than Summer.  Not a bad thing, though we don't get to vote, plus Antarctica is not lowering.

Not sure this paper gives a reasonable explanation, but is an attempt.  Feel free to give your thoughtful comments, for those able to read and process information, not just ""believe"".  Just posting ""denier"" isn't thoughtful.  Not my research paper, just throwing it out to readers.

The planet is experiencing wide-spread environmental degradation and destruction that falls under the umbrella of that term but which sometimes gets overlooked. 

An article from the NY Times begins: ""Global warming has focused  concern on land and sky as soaring temperatures intensify hurricanes,  droughts and wildfires. But another climate crisis is unfolding,  underfoot and out of view. Many of  the aquifers that supply 90 percent of the nation’s water systems, and  which have transformed vast stretches of America into some of the  world’s most bountiful farmland, are being severely depleted. These  declines are threatening irreversible harm to the American economy and  society as a whole.""

In other words, the US is has overpumped and overused its groundwater; acquifers --  the underground resevoirs that we get our water from. -- are shrinking. We are draining them  past the level they are able to replenish and once they are gone, we will have no water left. ""Nearly half the sites \[surveyed\] have declined significantly over the past 40 years  as more water has been pumped out than nature can replenish."" Even a casual reader very likely has read reports of communities in the Southwest literally running out of water or farmers having their irrigation water cut off because there just isn't any more water.

Based on all the evidence, I just can't bring myself to understand why this isn't priority number one. There are no other problems to solve until this is solved. No planet, no life.

5) Depending on toxicity/voltage, the ground remains available for human use (hiking, parks, etc), unlike traditional solar farms.

There are an average of 3.04 trillion trees in the world with an average processing capacity of 20 kg CO2 absorption per tree per year.  
   
Global CO2 emissions are approximately 36.4 billion metric tons per year (36.4 trillion kg).

Percentage = (Global CO2 Emissions / Total CO2 Processing Power of Trees) \* 100

Percentage = (36.4 trillion kg / 60.8 trillion kg) \* 100 ≈ 59.74%

Therefore, current global CO2 emissions are approximately 59.74% of the estimated total CO2 processing power of all trees on Earth. This suggests that the collective capacity of trees to absorb CO2 through photosynthesis is significantly greater than the current level of CO2 emissions produced by human activities.

"Canada has been the epicenter of the worlds worst heatwave across various parts of the country this season, and the fires follow the heat across the landscape.

Next time I’ll just use screenshots, lol. 

I’m qualifying “worst” as biggest departure from baseline conditions. 

Let’s get into it. 

Here is a map of average daily temperature anomalies across the globe in [May](https://climatereanalyzer.org/research_tools/monthly_maps/output_png/era5-0p5deg_56.png). This anomaly is compared against the average May temperatures between 1971-2000. 

Here is [June](https://climatereanalyzer.org/research_tools/monthly_maps/output_png/era5-0p5deg_58.png?1692754873600)

Here is [July](https://climatereanalyzer.org/research_tools/monthly_maps/output_png/era5-0p5deg_62.png)

I want you to now think about how fires have moved across the Canadian landscape this season. 

They began in the west in BC, Alberta, and Saskatchewan in [May](https://zoom.earth/maps/satellite-hd/#view=42.2,-92.4,3.68z/date=2023-05-20,pm/overlays=heat,fires)

In [June](https://zoom.earth/maps/satellite-hd/#view=43,-82.6,4.43z/date=2023-06-25,pm/overlays=heat,fires), while these fires continued, Quebec became the hotspot and dumped huge amounts of smoke down into New York. 

In [July](https://zoom.earth/maps/satellite-hd/#view=52.9,-109.6,4.54z/date=2023-07-25,pm/overlays=heat,fires) the Northwest Territories became the new hotspot. 

These maps should display orange heat anomalies where the fire is at. Sometimes it’s finnicky, feel free to pan around, to change the day, etc.  

There’s a better way to display these fires but this is just the quickest for me. Plus you can explore them yourself. 

Notice anything? 

The pattern of fire intensity followed the pattern of heatwave intensity! 

Notice how the May anomaly is concentrated in the west, how the June anomaly emerges in Quebec, and then how the July anomaly moves north. (May also had a big anomaly in the north but in the far north May is still very early spring).

Makes perfect sense when you consider scientific findings that the most important driver of fire activity in western North America is the aridity of the forest: https://imgur.com/a/KFhLLGA (such a powerful correlation visualized there).

In Canada they are obviously shattering all wildfire records by a huge amount. 

Regarding heatwaves, you can ""roll a 7 on the dice"" such that you're experiencing heat that literally was not even *possible* before global warming heated things up...or you can end up with a ""loaded dice"" such that the events are occurring more frequently but the events were still *possible* in a cooler world. So I guess that all makes sense. 

But look at some of the shocking heat that we've seen in South America. Is the idea that that heat would've reached *almost* to the levels that we've seen but that climate just ""tipped it over the edge"" such that the record was shatter? That's what's confusing; if climate change *contributed* to a record-breaking never-before-seen weather event then that contribution could be quite small and then the idea is that even without climate change the event would've been like a nearly-unprecedented and shocking thing but maybe the record would've remained intact. So that aspect of partial contribution is confusing. 

Then it's the same issue with the Canadian wildfires. It's totally apocalyptic; Canadians have never seen anything like this, though in recent years the people living in like British Columbia and Alberta have seen a lot of destruction and everything. But if climate is only *partially* contributing to what we're seeing right now in terms of wildfires then is the idea that the wildfires would still be catastrophic in an unwarmed world but just not quite *as* bad?

>The ongoing intensification in forest fire activity in California has had a dramatic impact on human activities and ecosystems alike. While an increase in temperatures and dryness has been identified to be one of the major drivers of increased summer forest burned area (BA), the extent to which such changes are due to natural variability or anthropogenic climate change remains unresolved. Using the latest simulations for climate change attribution and detection studies and accounting for the uncertainties arising from the data-driven climate-fire model and climate models, we quantify the influence of anthropogenic climate change on recent changes in BA. We show that nearly all of the observed increase in BA over the past half-century is attributable to anthropogenic climate change.

...

>Record-breaking summer forest fires have become a regular occurrence in California. Observations indicate a fivefold increase in summer burned area (BA) in forests in northern and central California during 1996 to 2021 relative to 1971 to 1995. While the higher temperature and increased dryness have been suggested to be the leading causes of increased BA, the extent to which BA changes are due to natural variability or anthropogenic climate change remains unresolved. Here, we develop a climate-driven model of summer BA evolution in California and combine it with natural-only and historical climate simulations to assess the importance of anthropogenic climate change on increased BA. Our results indicate that nearly all the observed increase in BA is due to anthropogenic climate change as historical model simulations accounting for anthropogenic forcing yield 172% (range 84 to 310%) more area burned than simulations with natural forcing only. We detect the signal of combined historical forcing on the observed BA emerging in 2001 with no detectable influence of the natural forcing alone. In addition, even when considering fuel limitations from fire-fuel feedbacks, a 3 to 52% increase in BA relative to the last decades is expected in the next decades (2031 to 2050), highlighting the need for proactive adaptations.",True,False,False,False

**WASHINGTON, D.C.** — As part of President Biden’s Investing in America [agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/?utm_source=invest.gov),  the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced up to $1.2 billion  to advance the development of two commercial-scale direct air capture  facilities in Texas and Louisiana. These projects—the first of this  scale in the United States—represent the initial selections from the  President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-funded Regional Direct Air  Capture (DAC) Hubs program, which aims to kickstart a nationwide network  of large-scale carbon removal sites to address legacy carbon dioxide  pollution and complement rapid emissions reductions. These emissions are  already in the atmosphere, fueling climate change and extreme weather  and jeopardizing public health and ecosystems across the globe. The Hubs  are expected to ensure meaningful community and labor engagement and  contribute to the President’s [Justice40 Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/).  Together, these projects are expected to remove more than 2 million  metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions each year from the  atmosphere—an amount equivalent to the annual emissions from roughly  445,000 gasoline-powered cars—and create 4,800 good-paying jobs in Texas  and Louisiana.

"Looking for Resources to Form a Cohesive, Comprehensive Argument to Present to Skeptics",8,Tri-angreal,1691801665.0,50,0.9,15oqaw7,climatechange,False,"Hey folks, TL;DR at the end.

I've been confronted by a number of folks who are yet to be convinced both that the climate is changing unusually, and that humans have a significant impact on that change. In conversation, I found myself unable to articulate the supporting argument to their (and more importantly my) satisfaction, and unable to cite specific sources or studies or results with supporting data.

So, a little unnerved at my irrationality, I went looking online.

And I am struggling to find anything that isn't propaganda. Everything I can find either presents a biased argument appealing to pathos and ethos, regardless of which side of the debate it comes down on; or which simply makes claims ex cathedra that the climate is changing as if it's a foregone conclusion. There're a lot of articles that assume climate change is real, and then tell the reader what they should do about it, but they *don't present the sources or data that back up that assumption.* At this point, I can't find any debate that isn't politicized into meaninglessness. I don't like presenting either side of an argument as idiots, because that immediately surrenders validity.

The rest present such a narrow slice of the science that it's too easy to dismiss. Like changes in a single lake's water level, or yearly temperatures in one city, or a single graph of temperatures with wonky axes, and only going back a century or two. I just got done reading an article that supported climate change, which mis-represented its graph entirely by pointing out the exact opposite conclusion that the graph suggested. Not a good look.

I know climate change is man-made; I've seen the comprehensive data and studies before. I just can't find them again to refresh myself enough to argue effectively.

So, assuming that my struggle is more a result of my poor google-fu than an actual lack of data, where  can I find a good review of literature presenting the evidence for and against the argument that climate change is anthropogenic? The best kind would be one that eschews emotional appeals and does not exhort the audience to action; just one that lays out in clear terms the evidence that lead scientists to conclude that we're having an effect, and what that effect is, and the mechanisms thereby.

A good textbook would also be acceptable. I just don't want to rely on the junk pop-sci propaganda that our side of the debate has devolved into. I don't need an advertisement to convince the masses to act; I need a bibliography to convince rational but so-far skeptical people.

**TL;DR. Want to find a good summary of supporting (and contradictory would be good--presenting both sides strengthens the argument) evidence including data and methodology for the claim that climate change is happening and is human-caused, which I can refer to quickly when asked to support that claim. Would prefer one that is without appeals to emotion and which does not seek to incite action, since these things can stink of rhetoric and weaken any arguments I want to make.**

**Basically, I just need a bibliography.**

Anyone know a good resource?

Now, did you ever consider that the liquid or spray you put on your face and body contribute to coral reef damage? Perhaps, perhaps not. 

I just read the news about the fast-moving wildfires on the Hawaiian island Maui and I was shocked. A news reporter explained that Maui’s unique ecosystems are vulnerable to fires, but that such incidents have environmental repercussions. He elaborated on how coral reef damage makes the coastlines way more vulnerable to storms (which is the cause of the rapidly spreading fires)

Climate change is real and I think we should be more considerate of our environmental footprint regarding our daily choices. Something as simple as the sunscreen you choose can make a huge impact. 

Avoid sunscreens that contain: *avobenzone, butylparaben, ecamsule octinoxate, oxybenzone or 4-methylbenzylidine camphor*.

Instead choose a physical sunscreen with *non-nano zinc oxide* or *titanium dioxide*. (Also there’s lots of great information on the internet or use ChatGpt for advice😉)

How to causally link weather events to increasing global average temps above baseline?,14,kylecmarshall,1691705378.0,62,0.82,15nq29p,climatechange,False,"Disclaimer: I have been a skeptic for many years, but I decided to actual dig into the scientific bases for global warming and climate change.

I started with how global temperature is actually measured and compared over time. Its was easy to see that the global average temperature above baseline is increasing and that increase has accelerated since 2000. Compelling cases were made that its was tied to industrialization and started at the industrial revolution.

In graduate school, I studied control theory and system dynamics. You learn that everything has its own response time. How long does it take something to react to a new stimulus? So I asked myself how fast is the response time of the environment to pollution stimulus? I read John Sterman's Ph.D. thesis ""Feedback complexity in integrated climate-economy models"". Not a light read at all. Inspired by the World3 model, he devised an economic model of the world coupled to a physical simulation of the climate (how pollution affects air/ocean temperature, how temperature affects the environments uptake of pollution, etc...)

You can see in his thesis that the environments response time to pollution is 50+ years. Meaning that if I instantly inject massive pollution into the environment, it would take about 50 years for the temperature to reach its maximum before it starts to decrease again. The pollution also decreases interesting enough by ocean sequestration. You can also clearly see that pollution caused by using natural resources lowers energy supply and effects the economy.

Okay so my next step and my biggest leap over my personal biases is to try to see climate change in terms of global warming.

Is there any scientific or academic research that can explain how global average temperature above baseline increases or pollution increases causes specific weather events to occur? Or is there a criteria that must be met before a weather event can be attributed to global warming?

This is a very difficult task to do. If you have ever studied chaotic non-linear system dynamics, you will learn that very simple systems can start to produce very complicated behavior. The double-rod pendulum and the lorentz attractor are common academic examples. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos\_theory#/media/File:Double-compound-pendulum.gif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory#/media/File:Double-compound-pendulum.gif)

Global weather modeling is a very chaotic system. The temperature error when forecasting the daily weather increases linearly by day and by day 12 it is about as accurate as an almanac at predicting the temperature.

I'm having a hard time reconciling all of this to see the climate activists point of view. It just seems really hard to link mathematically and practically weather events specifically to pollution / global warming.

Urgent Rescue Operation Underway as Bridge Collapses in Northern China due to Devastating Floods,13,areemiguel,1691140350.0,1,0.93,15huym5,climatechange,False," Hey fellow Redditors,

I hope you're all safe and sound wherever you are. Today, I came across some distressing news from northern China that I felt compelled to share with you all. According to state media reports, a highway bridge in Taipei collapsed due to flash floods triggered by heavy rains, causing two cars to plunge into the river below. Thankfully, there have been no reported casualties so far, but the situation remains critical.

Images published by local media show the aftermath of the incident, with the two badly damaged cars floating in the water. The bridge collapsed early this morning, and rescue operations are currently underway. As a result, a section of the Harbin-Mudanjiang Highway has been closed to ensure the safety of the public.This unfortunate incident is just one of many occurring across China as the country battles some of the worst floods it has seen in decades. Beijing, the capital city, recently experienced its heaviest rainfall in over 140 years, turning streets into canals and leaving emergency crews to navigate the city using rubber boats to rescue stranded residents. Tragically, two rescuers lost their lives in separate incidents while trying to save others.

The impact of these floods extends beyond Beijing. Zhuozhou, a small city in Hebei province, has been severely affected, with over 125,000 people being evacuated. In Heilongjiang, where the bridge collapsed, water levels on the Mayi River have exceeded safety levels, indicating ongoing risks of further flooding. Authorities in the eastern Shandong province have also warned of rising water levels on the Zhangwei River.While China was fortunate to be spared by Typhoon Khanun, which wreaked havoc in Japan, the country continues to face challenges as it battles the aftermath of these devastating floods. Water supply has been restored in Mentougou, a district in western Beijing that was severely affected, leading to the evacuation of thousands.In times like these, it's heartening to see organizations stepping up to help. Apple, food delivery app Meituan, and China's Red Cross Society have pledged donations to support relief efforts in the affected areas.Let's keep the people of China in our thoughts and hope for a swift and successful rescue operation.

One thing that I've been thinking a lot recently is my career path. I am currently in my second year of majoring in Biology. I've always had a passion for nature and animals, and I chose this because I wanted a job that felt meaningful to me - and Biology seems even more important with all these current climate change consequences we have going on. 
However, in my country Biology is a rather difficult career path. Many people graduate and don't manage to land jobs, or are paid poorly. Or I could also go the academia route, which would last for about 7 years and also doesn't pay that well. Most of the jobs for biologists here come from environamental licensing (you basically aid a company to hurt the environment slightly less), which I feel like also doesn't make much of a positive difference to the world.
With all the pessimist talk I've been thinking of the importance of having enough money to prepare for dire situations in the future: having enough for food, shelter, air conditioner, prepare for disasters etc. Having enough to save for retirement. I come from a middle-upper class family and so I've never had to worry much about those things, but in the future I definetely will as the world enters a climate crisis.
So my main question is: should I pursue a career in Biology, where I likely won't be paid very well but it's something I'm passionate about and aligns with by values, and could help the environment? Or should I go for a more stable career that would pay better, that I could work from home (which is good in case of extreme climate)? I've considered working as a programmer for this case. With more money I could also invest more time, money and energy into protecting myself and my community.

I don't know how troubled Alaskan / Siberian glaciers are and if that part of the circulation pattern is in imminent danger also.

As a for-instance, if the falling water around Greenland shuts down and Europe gets colder, might the surface water begin falling closer to Europe?  The point is that if some other circulation pattern starts up, it may become persistent and ""reversing global warming"" (by whatever means) may not bring things back to the way they were.

Battling Deadly Wildfires in Greece: Updates and Urgent Alert!,26,OnjoSimson,1690619269.0,2,0.94,15cmxdx,climatechange,False," Hey fellow Redditors,I hope you're all doing well. Today, I wanted to bring your attention to the ongoing fight against the devastating wildfires in Greece. The situation seems to be improving, but we must remain vigilant as fierce winds are forecasted, which could potentially rekindle the blazes.Currently, hundreds of courageous firefighters are battling flames on various Greek islands, including Rhodes, Corfu, and Evia. Additionally, a new front has emerged in central Greece, adding to the challenges faced by these brave individuals. It's not just Greece; fires have also flared up in Croatia, Italy, Portugal, and Algeria, claiming lives and leaving landscapes tinder dry.According to the Greek fire service, there are currently no spreading fires, and the situation is improving. However, they remain on a war footing to contain the ongoing fires. Just yesterday, more than 130 people were evacuated by boat from a town in central Greece after fires caused an explosion in an ammunition warehouse. Thankfully, the blaze has been contained, and residents have started returning home, although the force of the explosion shattered windows.The impact of these wildfires is immense. Tens of thousands of residents and tourists have been evacuated, disrupting the busy travel season. Rhodes, a popular holiday destination, has even declared a state of emergency. Tragically, we have lost four lives in this battle, including two pilots who died in a plane crash while fighting a blaze in Evia.Greece has been enduring an unprecedented heatwave for over 10 days now, with temperatures reaching a scorching 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) last weekend. Thankfully, the temperatures have started to fall, but the National weather forecaster EMY predicts strong winds of up to 60 kilometers (37 miles) per hour today.Let's take a moment to appreciate the bravery and dedication of the firefighters who are risking their lives to protect others and combat these wildfires. If you have any updates, personal experiences, or suggestions on how we can support those affected, please share them in the comments below. Together, we can raise awareness and extend our support to Greece during this challenging time.Stay safe, everyone!

The air and the water will recover, the earth will be renewed, and if it’s true that plastic is not degradable, well, the planet will simply incorporate plastic into a new paradigm: the Earth plus Plastic. The Earth doesn’t share our prejudice towards plastic. Plastic came out of the Earth; the Earth probably sees plastic as just another one of its children.

But I'm interested in finding (or making) a map that shows the occurrence of temperature and/or precipitation anomalies, especially in light of the heat waves and downpours that have struck various regions over the past few years. So a map that uses these sorts of calculations:

1. First a rolling 7-day difference in temperature is calculated (difference between highest high and lowest high, or conversely the highest low and lowest low)
2. Over a year, how many 7-day-differences show variations of more than 10 degrees? 20 degrees? Conversely, what are the places with the most consistent temperatures within any given 7-day period?

As someone who's interested in settling down somewhere with low climate variability (regardless of whether the average yearly temperature is increasing) I would find such a map very helpful.

Another few maps in this vein could be:

* A map showing number of times the threshold between freezing and thawing is passed, but only after eliminating streaks of such threshold crossings that last more than 7 days (which would hopefully eliminate normal seasonal changes from showing up, thus highlighting anomalies)
* A map showing number of rain events over the past 5 (or however many) years that exceeded the monthly average.

Climate change is junk science. 

The science of heat is governed by the laws of Thermodynamics. 

Heat is kinetic energy, the energy of motion - it does not get trapped by CO2 because it’s a gas. 

Yet this is the theory pushed by the climate change alarmists. 

To describe the impact of CO2 as being like a greenhouse is farcical. A greenhouse works by using a solid object to trap convection before the air cools and condenses. CO2 is not a solid object. 

CO2 absorbs and emits radiation. It does not trap convection. Furthermore it absorbs and emits incoming radiation at 2.8 microns while only absorbing outgoing radiation at 14.8 microns. 

Applying planks rule e = hv, the incoming radiation absorbed by CO2 is 5 times more powerful than the outgoing radiation absorbed. 

Regardless, as Einstein said in 1917, the amount of energy transferred by radiation is so small it always drops out. 

The most powerful form of heat transfer in the atmosphere is convection which is governed by the second law of thermodynamics. The entropy of a system must always increase. 

As such hot air will rise not fall. Outer space is negative 270 degrees Celsius. Our atmosphere is always losing heat because of this differential.

GWP* or GWP100 for accounting for methane emissions from cows.,10,lijas,1662195234.0,2,0.81,x4pr7r,climate_science,False,"I have been reading a bit about GWP\* lately. For you who dont know what it is, here is a paper discussing it:  [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6d7e](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6d7e)

[(or you can watch this explanation)](https://youtu.be/Gw7_qwT6IVI?t=296).

GWP\* is a way of determining the Global Warming Potential of GHGs based on changes in their emission rate. Lets look at the the methane emissions from cows as an example. If a countries cow population is kept constant, than the methane emissions from the cows would not further increase the global temperature, because the methane in the atmosphere is eventually broken down in to CO2. And since the total CO2 emmisions is not increased (due to the gases being in a closed system), the total warming potential of the methane from cows would be zero.

This would greatly affect how we rank food based on their environmental impact, which would make beef not look as bad as before.

* Daily we emit 117 million tons of CO2. Global CO2 emissions are 43 billion tons each year. [\[S\]](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
* As CO2 concentrations build in the atmosphere, infrared light radiated from earth's surface is absorbed by the CO2. Thus trapping heat in earth's atmosphere. This is known as the greenhouse effect. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect)
* 38% of global CO2 emissions have dissolved in the oceans. When CO2 dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid. This is known as ocean acidification. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_storage_of_carbon_dioxide) [\[S\]](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/feel2633/feel2633.shtml)
* The ocean has 50 times more CO2 than the atmosphere. The ocean has 39,000 billion tons of CO2. The atmosphere has 750 billion tons of CO2. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub)
* As the ocean becomes more acidic, less CO2 is able to be stored in the water. This leads to CO2 being released from the ocean and sent to the atmosphere. The same goes for ocean temperature. As water temperature rises, less CO2 is able to stay dissolved (e.g. leave a carbonated drink out on a warm day). [\[S\]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016RG000533)
* As temperatures rise, soil begins to increase the release of carbon in a process known as soil respiration. Researchers estimate soil carbon loss over the 21st century will be equivalent to two decades of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. [\[S\]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan2874)

# Solutions:

* **Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE):** Use mafic and ultramafic rocks (olivine, peridotite, etc.) to bind to CO2 and form carbonates. Thus converting CO2 into an alkaline carbonate mineral. These carbonates could then be placed in the ocean to raise the pH and bring it back to normal levels, and increase CO2 storage capacity in the ocean. [\[S\]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08561) [\[S\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00007/full)
* **Direct air capture (DAC):** Use large fans to concentrate CO2 into a chamber and then absorb the CO2 by various means. The CO2 can be converted into a long term storage medium such as a carbonate or left as vapor CO2. In the case of vapor CO2 there is some commercial value or it can be pumped into geological wells for storage. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_air_capture)
* **Renewable energy:** Wind, solar, geothermal, wave/tidal/marine power, etc. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy)
* **Cultured meats:** Growing meat from cell cultures instead of factory farming. This would free up billions of acres globally, democratize access to protein sources, and eliminate CO2 and CH4 emissions associated with factory farming. In the United States 41% of land use goes towards grazing and animal feed crops. These areas of land are usually high in sunlight and could be used for solar, wind, afforestation, or DAC.

* **Reducing fossil fuel emissions:** This can be done by scrubbing some of the CO2 from the source before emitting it to the atmosphere. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber)
* **Afforestation:** Afforestation is the establishment of a forest in an area where there was no previous tree cover. Tree-planting campaigns are sometimes criticized for targeting areas where forests would not naturally occur, such as grassland and savanna biomes. Afforestation can negatively affect ecosystems through increasing fragmentation, edge effects, and making the surface albedo darker (especially in northern regions).

What effects can lakes have on precipitation?,12,a694-reddit,1651708255.0,3,1.0,uik1me,climate_science,False,"I'm pretty interested in alternate history and specifically I've thought a lot about alternate nations in the western United States. Said area is very dry and is currently undergoing a drought, so I've thought of some alternate lakes that could exist in the area. But I'm not sure if they would actually have the precipitation effect I think they may have.

The two lakes are as follows:

1. Lake Cahuilla, which is effectively just the entire Salton Sink filled up. This lake existed not all that long ago but doesn't anymore. It's area would be around 5,700 sq km and it's in a very dry and high evaporation area.
2. Lake Idaho. This is an ancient lake that existed in the north-west area of the snake river valley in Idaho. It was around the size of lake Ontario. 

So the big question that I have is this. What would these lakes, if they existed today, possibly do to wetten the western U.S.A, both in their immediate area aswell as longer range effects. Could areas like the (un-submerged) snake river plain and other areas of Idaho be made lush by the massive lake? And would the surrounding mountains around the salton sink, and thus the water issue in the Colorado, by improved by the existence of lake Cahuilla.

My partner is an engineer, with a core interest is advanced math, he can translate the things i don't understand if lots of calculations is involved.I ask because I weave, crochet and knit and there are ways of doing it with sustainable materials plus making our own garments makes it easy to make exactly what we need when we need it instead of buying lots of cheap garments on sale that eventually ends up in fabric dumps in remote deserts. Often clothes are made in factories far away that pollutes a lot and consumes lots of energy that could be saved for all the obvious reasons. I realize not every one can knit their own socks but plenty can. And with socks from the right type of materials, a sweater and a scarf we don't all need 24 degrees c or higher inside all the time.

I often wonder where the balance between pleasure and pain should be in thousands of situations like that.

I realize it doesn't save the world knitting a pair of socks as such. But I know I don't need the same amount of Putins gas as before I knitted them. A rainbow scarf I wove on a strong wooden loom  will outlive me probably, due to the strength of different types of animal fibers in the yarn I used for weaving it. Most scarves I've bought throughout my life are gone and long forgotten and was of poor quality or petroleum based fibers because it was convenient.

Sustainable fibers for yarn or fabrics are worth a discussion of its own, and diffictult, and I've adjusted what I buy a lot myself.

Question on the Basics of Atmospheric General Circulation Models,10,jlhawn,1648589085.0,4,0.83,trn7s3,climate_science,False,"First, some background. About 10 years ago I took a physical geography class at UC Berkeley about climate systems. We learned a lot of the basic things like Earth's energy budget and atmospheric circulation (Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar Cells, ENSO, Coriolis effect, etc.). Since my study major was actually Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and not geography, for the final project of this class the professor allowed me to make a very basic energy balance model written in JavaScript (so it would run in a web browser). At the time, dealing with the physics of fluid circulation seemed too difficult and out of scope so I didn't even attempt it. This model was very basic in that it modeled the surface of the earth as a 2-dimensional grid with a resolution of only a few degrees of longitude and latitude. Each grid cell was designated as either ""land"" or ""ocean"" which were given different values for albedo and specific heat capacity. Each grid cell had a unit vector normal to the surface which was modeled as being flat. There was a global unit vector which pointed in the direction of the sun and would rotate around the earth's rotation axis once every simulated day. The time step was 30 minutes. Using the solar constant, the model would calculate the amount of radiation absorbed and reflected by a surface cell given its position and this heat would be transported across the surface at different rates depending on whether the cell was land or ocean and calculate a new temperature for that location. There were a few other parameters which controlled the rate of radiation emitted back into space. Over time, a balance would be reached where the average global temperature would fluctuate around a stable value with the day/night cycle.

Anyway, I now have the of time to study how to make a very basic atmospheric circulation model. I don't need or expect it to be an accurate model of the earth. At the moment, I am not interested in modeling ocean circulation or even the humidity. I am only interested in modeling a uniform spherical surface with dry air as the fluid. This sphere will be heated by radiation which comes from a direction that rotates around the sphere as in the energy balance model described above. The major difference is that now I want to model the fluid dynamics on the surface of this rotating sphere. I have a pretty good understanding of the forces that act on moving fluids on a rotating body like the Coriolis effect, pressure gradient force, gravitational force, etc., and I'm confident that I can program anything once I understand it, but, in attempting to read up on how an atmospheric general circulation model works, I am running into issues with my understanding.

I quickly found out that atmospheric circulation models *do not use height (z)* as the vertical coordinate. Instead they tend to use pressure coordinates. This is useful because pressure decreases monotonically with elevation so that given a surface pressure and temperature gradient with pressure we can calculate the height in meters above the surface. This is why weather maps for winds at different ""heights"" use millibar (or hectopascal) heights. From what I have read, the great thing about using pressure as a vertical coordinate is that it's easier to write a model which assumes hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction, i.e., the pressure gradient and gravitational forces are balanced (I understand that this isn't exactly *correct* but is a good assumption to make at *synoptic* scale). Using pressure coordinates also allows us to model horizontal flow using a *geostrophic approximation*. So ""horizontal"" is actually horizontal with respect to a constant pressure surface.

That brings me to the part that I do not understand. If the model assumes hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction, how can there ever be any vertical motion? Can there be a net acceleration in the vertical direction under the assumption that the pressure gradient force is in balance with the gravitational force? **edit**: To attempt to answer my own question, I think the explanation is that by using pressure as the vertical coordinate we sacrifice knowing or caring about vertical positional velocity in *meters per second* to instead only consider pressure velocity in *pascals per second.* Is this the correct way to understand it?

And if every direction in the horizontal has the same pressure, how can there be any net acceleration in the horizontal direction? There would be no pressure gradient in the horizontal direction!

I must be fundamentally misunderstanding something about how these models work. Can someone please help me to understand? Thank you.

From looking at the Wikipedia article on [Primitive Equations - Presssure Coordinates in Vertical, Cartesian Tangential plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_equations#Pressure_coordinate_in_vertical,_Cartesian_tangential_plane), It looks like horizontal acceleration is also supposed to depend on changes in *Geopotential* with respect to changes in horizontal position along a constant-pressure surface. So maybe I need a better understanding of how geopotential relates to pressure and temperature.

This raises another question though, which is how do I keep track of where the sphere's surface is on a vertical pressure scale? If the pressure at the surface changes (though is generally somewhere around 100,000 Pa) does that mean I need to keep track of ""where"" the surface is along the vertical scale for a column of air too? If so, how? **edit**: To attempt to answer my own question again, I think this also has to do with the concept of *Geopotential* which should be zero at the surface of the sphere. I haven't been able to find any equation for the Geopotential as a function of pressure and temperature, but there is an equation for the *partial derivative* of Geopotential as a function of pressure and temperature.

What are some climate policies that started in California and scaled to the US or beyond?,10,0x768,1648075321.0,3,0.78,tlj8oc,climate_science,False,"In my reading about climate change, I stumbled on some cases where clean-air and climate-change policies started in California and then scaled to other places. For example...

* In the 1960s, California adopted CAAQS, which regulated airborne pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. In 1971, the US EPA enacted a similar policy called NAAQS, which applies to the whole United States. (admittedly these substances aren't really greenhouse gases, but they're still pollutants that are worth reducing.) \[1\]
* In 2002, the California Air Resources Board passed AB 1493, which limits tailpipe emissions from cars. By 2006, 10 states had adopted the same policy. \[2\]

This got me wondering: is California (or any other specific state) a good ""proving ground"" for new climate policies that can potentially be adopted nationwide?

How can a math person best contribute to climate solutions?,23,Aromatic-Sir-4269,1647984288.0,37,0.78,tkdkcr,climate_science,False,"I have a background in physics and mathematics, and I've been spending a lot of time researching the different paths I could take to maximize my positive impact on Earth's environment. The scale and complexity of modern environmental issues makes it difficult to get a sense for what to focus on, so I wanted to crowdsource some thoughts on this and get a discussion going. 

Besides the title question, I also specifically wanted to hear some thoughts on these (related) questions:

1. Are there any fields of research or niches in industry related to climate (or the environment in general) where the necessary advances are mathematical, ""pen-and-paper""/""keyboard-and-computer"" problems?
2. Between developing solutions and understanding global systems' responses to existing solutions, what deserves more attention? Or is it all politics now? 

It seems like there is a wave of people with questions to the tune of ""how can I be a part of the solution?"", so this is both me selfishly asking for career advice and me hoping to add to the growing pile of Internet advice for people who want to dedicate their careers to solving global problems, but have no idea where to start.

"Is a stable climatic state with a Northeastern Asia with far warmer, wetter winters possible? More generally, is climate almost fully geographically/orbitally determined, or is it possible for alternate stable climate states to exist?",13,GrantExploit,1647848012.0,1,0.8,tj65rd,climate_science,False,"I've been developing, on and off for the past nearly 10 years in some form\*, a speculative evolution and alternate history scenario based on this main premise:

**What if the Siberian Anticyclone was a far weaker/less permanent phenomenon, leading to the climate of Northeastern Asia being significantly warmer and wetter in winter†, i.e. generally more North American?**

The problem is, the geography and Milanković characteristics of the Earth are supposed to be nearly identical to that IRL. Indeed, significantly changing it would defeat the point of the timeline—it features an alternate *Asia*, not a continent that somewhat resembles Asia—and would be largely impossible given the Point of Divergence of at earliest 880 kya.

Also, while I know that it *may* be possible for mass-extinction-level events to create new climatic equilibria, there also isn't a mass extinction in the scenario. So... ***is this even possible?***

I can see 2 possibilities:

1. Geography, orbital, and broad atmospheric characteristics almost always overpower and dampen even the most exceptional (sub-mass-extinctional) ""initial weather state"" conditions. This would be good because it would indicate that the climates of my patently fictional worlds (along with alternate geographies) would be able to be strictly and accurately predicted, but would effectively kill the aforementioned project.
2. An exceptional but sub-mass-extinctional ""initial weather state"" (i.e. pressure and wind patterns, temperatures, ground albedo, momentary atmospheric concentrations) can result in the transition to a new stable climate state, despite geography and orbital characteristics remaining the same. This would have nearly the opposite effect—while supporting the project mentioned, it would make determining the climates of my patently fictional worlds (along with alternate geographies) much more difficult.

**Which is true, for this situation and more generally?**

\*Well, it was a proposal for a future climate geoengineering project from 2012–7, more of an alternate history from 2017–9, and more speculative evolution from 2019–.

What are the realistic best and worst case scenarios for our future?,26,,1644894247.0,28,0.86,sssqw9,climate_science,False,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, so please let me know. Also, while I'm open to any answers, I would really appreciate it if people with genuine scientific credentials and/or trustworthy  sources could respond.

I know that climate change is not a binary issue with one or two endings, and I know that accurately predicting Human behaviours is incredibly difficult, so I'm not expecting a perfect answer to this question. 

Having said that:

Based on our current level of emissions, the positive feedback loops we have been able to identify and the direction society seems to be heading, what are the best and worst case scenarios for the environmental crisis? More specifically, within the near to midterms- say 2030 to 2100.

Most of the optimistic scenarios I've seen bandied about involve a sudden political and social shift all over the world; leading governments to rapidly implement all of the Glasgow climate pledges, electrify the grid, cut back on animal agriculture and attain net zero prior to 2050, before using carbon capture and reforestation to restore the Earth back to preindustrial health.

As wonderful as this would be, and as much as we should strive for something like it, it also seems incredibly unlikely. While environmental policies and activism are improving, I can't really see this all happening in such a short time.

On the other end of the spectrum you also have radical pessimists who believe that it's already too late to do anything and that tipping points will devastate the entire planet within the immediate future- leading to the collapse of civilisation by the 2040's (or as soon as 2026 in the most extreme cases) and an end to all life on Earth.

Again, this doesn't seem to be supported by any legitimate scientist. In fact, it has been suggested by several scientists that both blind hope and doomism have been weaponized by the corporate media as a means of sabotaging genuine action.

If we fail to cut back on our emissions and other destructive activities over these coming years and decades, is it plausible that Humans could become extinct? Could positive feedback loops actually render the entire planet uninhabitable?

How can we attain the organised action necessary to get us to a happier ending? What steps do we need to be taking to mitigate global warming, beyond electrifying the grid and phasing out fossil fuels?

I'm extremely pro-science and analytical. I don't think based on emotions at all and am here to genuinely learn from individuals more intelligent than me on this topic. I also trust that humans are impacting the climate.

&#x200B;

My main question is, how do we know how much impact humans are having on the climate. Not whether we are, or are not...but by how much.

I've seen the NASA graphic that shows how much more CO2 is in the atmosphere over the last 50 years, but are we using a different form of measurement in modern history versus how we speculate/measured it over generations before which could learn to large margins of error? This is possibly not true at all, but these are the types of questions I'm seeking to understand.

Also, I'm under the impression that other major climate changes were due to variations in orbit and so therefore there are other potential impacts on climate change outside of CO2. This would put some level of uncertainty on what magnitude of impact we have on climate change due to other outside factors?

&#x200B;

I assume there is not an exact amount that we can correlate human impact to climate change, but I'm curious at what level of certainty are we with what level of magnitude? Are we 99% certain that we are the cause for 75% of the temp increases, etc.? I assume that confidence level diminishes the higher we hypothesize the impact.

On the one hand, as we all know, climate change is a crisis of enormous proportions and I completely support their intentions (I do not want to get into a discussion about methods). 

On the other hand, something that troubles me is that their namesake argument, that climate change represents an ""extinction level threat"" to humanity (with similar messages consistently used in their campaigning) or will lead to the collapse of human civilization is, to put it mildly, not supported by the evidence. In _Global Catastrophic Risks_ (2008), Frame and Allen conclude that, whilst immensely damaging, climate change _""would not necessarily be catastrophic in the sense of being a terminal threat""_ and since this book's publication, I have yet to read a paper arguing that climate change represents an extinction-level threat for humanity.

Of course, the error that Extinction Rebellion (and similar groups) is making is the assumption that the threshold of a catastrophe is human extinction. This is clearly not true because something can be catastrophic to human society (which climate change is) whilst not posing a literal threat to our existence (which climate change does not, or at least there is no evidence for this). 

My question is, is this actually a problem, or is this just academic pedantry? Putting my role as a scientist aside, my worry is that making claims that are _technically_ incorrect (even though the broad message that climate change is catastrophic is correct) makes it easier to deny campaigners' arguments over technicalities rather than actually engaging in the substance of the argument. Or similarly, that laypeople will just dismiss them as fanatics/hysterics. On the other hand, their campaigning does seem to be quite successful (a lot more successful than us climate scientists making technically correct statements on twitter and university press releases) and I haven't actually seen anybody using this counterargument I'm worrying about.

How much is 1 Gt Co2e?,29,Nthn_McClure,1635345699.0,15,0.88,qgy8tq,climate_science,False,"Hey all, 

So I've just finished an essay on the impact feed additives can have in reducing methane emissions in cattle, and I've got the figure that if all the 1.5 b cattle were fed 3-NOP which achieves a ~30% decrease in methane emissions, then a 0.83 Gt Co2e reduction would be caused. 

The thing is, I can't find any papers to give any sort of data to out this figure in perspective. I can find websites which all claim trees absorb different masses of co2 annually, none of which are based on any scientific papers, and I can find any papers with data about the average mass of co2 released annually by diesel cars either.

New here. How can I find the following data please ?,31,zagdem,1634141070.0,4,0.97,q7ed9d,climate_science,False,"Hi,

I'm looking for ways to persuade people to take action against the climate crisis (I think we all are). In order to do that, I'd like to express the crisis in non technical terms, but rather than that, in human lives. 

Here is what it would look like :

>Dear fellow human. You probably know that we, as a society, have to reduce our CO2 consumption under X1 ... but if you're like me you don't know what that means. Well, for you, it means that your target should be X2 = X1/numberofhumans. That's equivalent to (blablabla). Is that more clear ? Well, no. I know.  
>  
>So let's frame it otherwise. The consequence of the climate crisis will be very bad, and people will die because of it. How much of them ? Well, it is hard to count, but we can give a reasonable estimate. It turns out that you being personally responsible for a CO2 target of X2 is equivalent to being responsible for the death of X3 adults, X4 children. Worse, X5 time more humans are gonna face war, starvation, or migration to a distinct country because of it.  
>  
>That's a lot of responsibility on your shoulders, and the bad news is, your individual action (being vegan, not using your car, ...) can only cover X6% of the reduction you need to do. The next (100-X6)% has to come from corporations, governments, etc... So, if you care about the lifes of the X3 adults and X4 children you are personally responsible for, you have to fight for them.  You have to force your leaders, governments and companies, to change everything. They can't fight for themselves now. You can. You are their only chance. Do it.

Now, in order to write that with actual figures, I'm looking for the following data :

* X1 - What is our current CO2 consumption, and what it should be (I believe I can find it in the IPCC report. Is it a good source here ?).
* X2 - Easy one, all I need is the number of humans. I can handle it :)
* X3, X4 and X5 are hard. Here, we need to convert climate scenarios into geopolitical ones. Are there scientists who have worked on this, and can provide reasonably realistic estimates (I mean, even order of magnitudes ones). Also, I'm aware I'll need a set target date for this. 2040 ? 2050 ? 2100 ? I think I'll go with the data we have here, depending on the source we can find.
* X6 - What percentage of the CO2 effort can come from individual action (not eating meat, etc...). I believe I've read that the value is around 25%, but I need a source.

I hope some of you can help find this data. It is a small piece of text, but if we can build this, we can also convert any CO2 measurement into an individual count of lifes. It changes the communication game imo.

Thank you for your help,

Regards,

*Note : I'm also aware of a strong bias depending on whih country we're talking about. The world as a whole ? The US ? Europe ? Canada ? The figures aren't the same. That said, I'll take any help you can give, and I'll see what I can write depending on the data we have ... or not :)*",True,False,False,False

During the most extreme periods (e.g. the times immediately following the Huronian and Cryogenian glaciation and possibly the end-Permian), a total lack of glaciation *may* make sense, but I struggle to imagine how other greenhouse periods like the mid-Cretaceous, or the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum with its ""mere"" 8 °C warming would fit that description, because of the *sheer margin* by which some places remain within thermal conditions conducive to glaciation on present Earth.

For instance, both Vostok and Plateau Station (at \~3,500 meters elevation) could warm by a whopping *32 °C* before their warmest-month averages peak above freezing. Even if the temperature anomaly at the poles was 3 times greater than the global average, it would seem to me that mountains analogous to the Gamburtzevs (which peak at \~2,700 meters elevation underneath that vague area of Antarctica, equating to being at most \~8 °C warmer according to the temperature lapse rate) should still be able to support alpine glaciation let alone just seasonal snowfall under PETM-like conditions.

And given that locations with winters at least as as warm as Tampico (average temperature in coldest month 18.8 °C) have recorded snowfall while no places with average coldest month temperatures below \~7 °C haven't, the idea that *any* planet cool enough to avoid a Venusian-style runaway greenhouse effect with vaguely Earth-like orbital and rotational properties would *entirely* lack snow and frost appears patently ludicrous.

So, is it thought that small-scale alpine glaciation or at least seasonal snow and frost existed in some of the coldest areas on Earth during those periods? If so, to what extent in each? If not... ***how?!?***",True,False,False,False

climate changes -- the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth,
as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence
that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor. But actually there is much agreement between
[the scientific
part of the UN's IPCC - i.e. the Working Group I - (""group one"") and scientists who do not regard anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions as an especially serious problem (""group two"")]. The following are such points of agreement:

>1. The climate is always changing.
2. CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life
on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming.
3. Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century.
4. Over this period (the past two centuries),
the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees
Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960’s have man’s greenhouse
emissions been sufficient to play a role.
5. Given the complexity of climate, no confident
prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC, acknowledged
in its own 2007 report that “The long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.” Most importantly, the scenario that the burning of fossil fuels
leads to catastrophe isn’t part of what either group asserts.

Given the calibre of the ""sceptic"" in question, is the only recourse to verify in the literature each claim - even implicit and general ones that, in turn, contain further claims - in order to see which ones are demonstrably false and post a rebuke with references?

Tipping points: when does a 10% chance become a 100% certainty?,45,Tliish,1627508091.0,3,1.0,otjlin,climate_science,False,"The links are to good articles on the subject on Grist and Quanta.

In the Grist article, a number of climatologists talk about the tipping points in their respective fields, a decent array, but by no means a majority of the fields encompassing climate change.

A frequent risk assessment of individual areas is put at somewhere around 10% or less probability of occurring, with some discussion of cascade events, one breached tipping point leading to another, but despite the idea of tipping points, all the climatologists still seem to think that changes will be slow on human time scales. But while any individual tipping point may have a low to extremely low likelihood of occurring, if you have enough low-probability possibilities, you wind up with a near 100% chance that *one* of them will happen, which has the potential to raise the probability that others will be more likely to occur.

What I wonder is what happens if a heat dome similar the recent one over Canada (which killed \~1 billion sea animals, likely a tipping point for that ecosystem), and the present one over the Kansas/Missouri/Oklahoma/Texas area, each very low probability events, were to settle over Greenland? It wouldn't need to be as hot to have a major effect: even 5-10C over normal for a week would have profound effects.

There are many other examples. Each month it seems that new factors/feedback loops we hadn't thought of keep emerging, like the melting of the permafrost leading to wildfires which leads to more permafrost melting.

The Quanta magazine article concerns discoveries made over the last decade about carbon sequestration in soils that upends the commonly held notions about how likely we will be able to find ways to put the carbon into it. The problem is that most climate models are using erroneous assumptions about that, leading to over-optimistic assessments.

My point in all this is that we need to stop thinking that severe climate change events are not likely to happen over the next five to ten years, and start assuming that we are currently in a worst-case scenario and act accordingly. If it turns out we overestimated the danger and actually had more time, all's well and good, the only thing ""lost"" is perhaps money. However, if we continue to act as if we were living in a less-than-worst case to much-less-than-worst case, and allow several tipping points to be breached, we won't be able to recover.

Climate change is neither linear nor uniform. Some regional climates are changing much faster than others, and tipping points are far too close for comfort, some timeframes for them are within the margin of error. The entire world needn't hit 2-4C of warming for massive changes and problems to occur. If some regions hit that, then the likelihood of cascade events become far higher.

Encourage climatologists wherever you can to stop talking in terms of centuries and millennia when they discuss climate change, that just makes people dismissive of the subject, because the average person and politician don't care what happens in a century, much less in 10,000 years, they care about what happens this year, next year, and next decade at most. we need to focus on what's happening now, what's going to happen next year, and the next decade, because that's nearly all the time we have left to slow things down enough to have a decent chance at survival. Targeting 2050 is near-suicidal at this point, it virtually guarantees 2C+ of warming by 2040.

We really and truly don't have much time left, and what time we do have can be radically altered if we hit any of those tipping points.",True,False,False,False

Since the begining of the industrial revolution soil degradation added 50-100GT of CO2 to the atmosphere according to that study. For comparison, the total anthropogenic emissions since then were 450GT.

A third of the topsoil has been lost, so 1% topsoil loss should equal 15-30GT of CO2 released to the atmosphere. Our total emissions in 2019 were 36GT.

So how much topsoil do we currently lose each year ?

How would biomes in different climates change? For example: Would a temperate climate, such as Britain's, become more arid? How does research suggest it would change the landscape? Would vegetation die and leave dry lands or would it be substituted by vegetation that can better cope with the new climate?

Would you still be able to see the sun or would the sky be filled with a thick layer of clouds?

How would oxygen levels change? How could humans and animals adapt to those changes?

How high would radiation level rise? Would this make it impossible for humans to walk outside without protection?

I might have other questions later.

Options 5) A video about the massive (estimated) impact on having kids on one's carbon footprint. Could emphasize importance of considering adoption or foster care instead of having kids

To me, it seems that the wider public can almost be split into three camps at this point:

There are the denials, who seem to be able to ignore reality.

Then there are the people who kind of realize that climate change is a major threat that needs to be dealt with. But as long as people fly a bit less and gradually switch to electric cars and do some fine tuning, everything will be fine. 

Then there are people who see it as an existential threat in the very near future.

I just feel that what would be needed to save humanity, would be a 180 degree turn. That there is no time to wait until 2050 or so to become carbon neutral.

Arctic ice is declining year by year. Mass extinctions are well underway. Permafrost is melting. Seasons have become less reliable. I live in Finland, and last year it is fair to say that we did not have a real winter. 

I am only 26, and yet I have seen a marked change even during my lifetime. Example: as a child and teenager, I used to play a lot of ice-hockey outside during the winters. Last several years the temperature has not been reliably below freezing for extended periods, so ice-hockey season has become weeks instead of moths. Instead of reliable less than -5, we often get spikes above 0, which ruins the ice. 

Silly example maybe, but that is an example of how I don’t understand how people don’t see what is happening right in front of our eyes.

I have read a fair bit of Guy McPherson, Paul Beckwith and others. I’ve also read that they are too alarmist, but I have not read any proper debunking of their positions. Especially global dimming seems to turn our situation to a catch-22, but that is almost never discussed in the mainstream.

Fundamentally, I am a person who wants to have a family at some point. But I have given up hope on that. I have also given up hope on reaching 40 years of age myself. For the last year and a half, I have become cynical and lived as if in hospice.

I am not new to climate issues. I remember first being disillusioned in 2009 when the Copenhagen summit was hyped up and then led to no action. 

I have tried to find optimism, but I have failed. I see Paris climate accord as a delusional hope, and yet almost all countries are even failing to keep on track with those demands.

Climate sensitivity based on models vs ice core data,21,Sabiba,1596326436.0,3,0.89,i22kyv,climate_science,False,"Recent [estimations](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/climate-change-equilibrium-climate-sensitivity-global-warming/) of climate sensitivity imply that the steady state temperature increase from a doubling of C02 above pre-industrial levels (560 PPM) is between 2.6C and 4.1C.  This is a similar although narrower estimate than other mainstream estimates.

I came across this [paper](http://www.highstand.org/erohling/Rohling-papers/2009-Rohling%20et%20al%20AAtemp-sealevel%20ngeo557.pdf) which looks at the relationship between global C02 and temperature from antarctic ice core data.  This [figure](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Antarctic-temperature-and-global-sea-level-closely-Rohling-Grant/6dce13db600210d9e5c3fd2cd44f7714da867f59/figure/1) from the paper plots C02 vs Temperature, and draws a trend line which intersects with 387 ppm C02.  The Temperature of this intersection is 16C above anthropogenic levels.  This [paper](http://www.globalcoral.org/_oldgcra/AOSIS%20Briefing%202009.pdf#page=6) references the figure and re-affirms the implication, mentioning that it will take thousands of years to reach this steady state.  The original paper mentions that one explanation for the difference of models with lower estimates is that the trend line could curve upward (like the low, middle, and high lines in green) rather than be straight, but even if that were the case, it seems extremely unlikely that, based on the ice core data, a C02 level of 560 ppm would lead to anywhere near as low as 2.6-4.1C.

The most recent period with C02 levels near present day of \~400 ppm was the [mid-pliocene](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/52/13288), which had ""a mean annual surface temperatures approximately 1.8 °C to 3.6 °C warmer than preindustrial temperatures"".  How did 400 ppm yield a much lower temperature than implied by the [chart](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Antarctic-temperature-and-global-sea-level-closely-Rohling-Grant/6dce13db600210d9e5c3fd2cd44f7714da867f59/figure/1) of ice core data, especially considering the ice core chart has data points of 3-4C with C02 less than 300 ppm?  Even if the Mid-pliocene data gives a more accurate climate sensitivity, it seems it would be a much higher sensitivity than what present day mainstream modelers are suggesting, i.e. mid-pliocene implies 560 ppm would lead to higher temps than 2.6-4.1C.  

TLDR: Why is the climate sensitivity in mainstream models different (lower) than what geological ice core data suggests?",True,False,False,False

How will climate change affect winter storms and swell?,8,bottles24,1595684014.0,4,0.8,hxmsby,climate_science,False,"

I asked a similar question in r/surfing a couple of months ago:

How will the pole‘s ice melting affect the low pressure systems, known in the surfing world as ground swell( huge storms traveling between 30 degrees latitude and 60 degrees latitude),especially in the northern hemisphere?

With the ice of the poles melting, the temperature difference between the poles and the mid lattitudes in the air will likely decrease. This will in turn produce less big storms in Winter, which will ultimately produce less ground swell all around the world, but in particular in the northern hemisphere. Here the ice is melting first. 

That’s what i think could be happening. I read articles that stated storms will get more extreme. But i think that is only true for tropical storms. 

What do you think?
How will this affect the waves and Surf all over the world? In particular Europe and Northern America ? Do you agree with my hypothesis?

1980-2003 Natural variation in latent heat flux,21,DrDolittle,1580974879.0,4,0.84,ezoy9q,climate_science,False,"Much of modern warming occurred between ~1980 and ~2000, [HADCRUT](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/HadCRUT4.png) puts warming at +0.5°C, and as I shall argue, the magnitude of temperature increase cannot be fully explained by either changes in solar output (1W/m2 output) nor increased CO2 (~1W/m2 surface).

Ocean **surface vaporization** and associated **latent heat flux** [\[1\]](http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/climatechange1/07_2.shtml) is the fundamental [driver](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/52009254_The_Role_of_Water_Vapor_Feedback_in_Unperturbed_Climate_Variability_and_Global_Warming) of natural climate variability (see [Clark](http://venturaphotonics.com/files/CoupledThermalReservoir_Part_I_E_EDraft.pdf) or [\[ch3.4\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) for review of ocean thermodynamics):

- Latent heat flux is created as solar radiation heats ocean surfaces, causing vaporization. 
- Vaporization then cools ocean surfaces as ""latent heat"" and water vapor are transferred to the atmosphere.
- This process creates clouds and rain and upward air circulation and heats the atmosphere, and 
- the latent heat is transported by air currents to higher latitudes.

So latent heat flux transports solar radiation and water vapor from oceans to atmosphere and redistributes energy and water vapor. The amplitude of the latent heat flux process depends on the amount of solar radiation that reaches the ocean's surface, which again dependens on atmosphere albedo, clouds and aresols. Latent heat flux is fundamental in cloud formation and is proportional to surface wind speeds, both potential feedback loops. The effects on climate to a hypothetical change in latent heat flux is shown to be quite significant in [simulations](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/courseware/water-water-everywhere.html).

Latent heat flux **increased 10% or about 9 W/m2** from 1980 to 2003 [\[fig\]](https://imgur.com/a/GqIe3q1) [\[paper\]](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-88-4-527) [\[ch3:fig6\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) and this is **attributed to ""natural variations"" in AR5** [\[ch3.4.2.2\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) [\[paper\]](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00148.1). The magnitude of the increase excludes CO2-downwelling as the cause (ΔF = ~5.35×ln (373/338) = 0.52 W/m2 before feedbacks).

Changes in **ocean heat content** are significant as
- bulk of earth emissions imbalance (difference between earth incoming and outgoing radiation) goes to ocean heating, due to ocean's large mass and heat capacity [\[ch3:box 3.1\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/), and as
- continental warming due to human activity is believed to be [80-90%](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL051106#grl29030-bib-0009) dominated by indirect warming from oceans. 

Since 2003 the derivative of ocean heat content and the derivative of the earth emissions imbalance both appear to be declining \[[Fig15](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331886058_Decadal_Changes_of_the_Reflected_Solar_Radiation_and_the_Earth_Energy_Imbalance)\], and this decline corresponds with the 2003 peak in latent heat flux. Ocean heat content, earth emissions imbalance and latent heat flux all indicate that the cause of the 1980-2003 anomaly has subsided.

**""Global brightening""** is one plausible theory for the heat flux anomaly, the shortwave (solar-)radiation reaching the surface appears to have increased significantly over the period [\[1983-2001\]](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=18825) due to changes in clouds or atmospheric aerosols.

**Since the period 1980-2003 has a 0.5-1 W/m2 expected increase in CO2-downwelling, and a 9 W/m2 measured increase in latent heat flux due to ""natural variation"", much of the warming in this period must also be due to natural variation. Logically, this could have occurred in one of two ways:** 
- **increases in temperature and latent heat flux have a common cause, such as ""global brightening"", or** 
- **latent heat flux increase, what ever its cause, caused the surface warming.**

*Edit: the significance of global brightening is underlined by the observation that the last half of the 20th century is believed to be the period of highest solar activity in the last 8000 years [[figure]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sunspot-number-reconstructed-from-the-concentration-of-the-cosmogenic-isotope-14-C-after_fig1_258806419)[[paper]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258806419_European_Solar_Physics_moving_from_SOHO_to_Solar_Orbiter_and_beyond)*",True,False,False,False

Water vapor is the main driver of the greenhouse effect and while regular planes emit both water and co2, a hydrogen plane would emit probably more water into the stratosphere since water is the only chemical reaction product.

Now it gets even more confusing for me. Afaik Water vapor is a transperant gas while clouds and artificial clouds from airplanes are already condensed water into tiny droplets. The vapor is a greenhouse gas but the clouds or droplets are actually having a positive effect because they reflect visible light coming from the sun.
Edit: apparently only low altitude clouds are having a cooling effect on the planet while high altitude clouds like these from airplanes are actually further contributing to the greenhouse effect.

Now the question is. What happens to the artificial clouds from airplanes? Do they evaporate and add to the amount of water vapor in the stratosphere?
If so, how big is that effect on the climate compared to the co2 emissions of a regular plane.

Can clear-sky measurements of CO2 radiative forcing be used to calibrate radiative forcing models?,13,DrDolittle,1579682868.0,1,1.0,es9b2t,climate_science,False,"*Can anyone here knowledgeable in climate science chime in and provide any feedback on why ""clear-sky"" studies like this can or can't be used in the manner described below? Any help much appreciated.*

The CO2 radiative forcing term is often modelled as

*Δ F=k ln(c/c0),*

where *k* in AR3 is *5.35* (page 358 in the ""WG1 physical basis"")*.*

Now in a 2015 Nature article by Feldmann *""Observational determination of surface radiative forcing by CO2 from 2000 to 2010""*, the radiative effect of CO2 was [observed](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14240) to be **0.2** **W/m2** over the decade for 2000-2010(see [Figure 4](https://imgur.com/a/OErknh0)), during which CO2 increased from 370ppm to 392 ppm.

This is 30% lower than what the IPCC model states:

*Δ F=5.35\* ln(392/370) =* ***0.309 W/m2.***

To approximate the result of the Nature article, the parameter  *k* should have been reduced to *\~3.6:*

*Δ F=3.6\* ln(392/370) =* ***0.207 W/m2***.

**Feldmann and co-authors appear to not have noticed or commented that the radiative forcing they found was low in their paper.**

ECS can be [split](https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/clip_image0022.jpg) into *pre-feedback climate sensitivity* and a *post-feedback gain factor,* and the radiative forcing of CO2 is a factor in pre-climate sensitivity.

**Thus a reduced radiative forcing estimate by 30% would mean that ECS estimates from IPCC models should be reduced by 30% as well.**

Challenging the CO2 minimum hypothesis,4,,1578280664.0,36,0.58,eknyhi,climate_science,False,"I would like some clarification of the following claims if some of you could spare the time:

We are at a CO2 minimum for geological time scale. As in 99.9999% of Earth's history had more CO2 than present.

When the Earth had 3,000 ppm (About 7 times the total concentration of present) there was more diversity of life, large plants, larger trees, and thriving eco systems.

The Earth literally had an atmosphere primarily composed of CO2 for the first billion years of its history. Algae in the oceans formed and absorbed it and turned it into O2.

The entire history of industrial activity for humans we have gone from 280 ppm to ~410 ppm. So we haven't even seen a single doubling of CO2 in our atmosphere.

The most CO2 has been released in the last 20 years than previous decades, yet global temperatures stagnated. Meaning CO2 sensitivity is greatly out pace by natural factors such as the PDO cycle.

The Earth saw cooling for 3 decades during 1940 to 1970 even though we saw CO2 rising across the globe. This is part of the reason people feared an ""Ice Age"" (Glaciation period) for returning.

Warming is not equally distributive, and actually happens more so towards the poles. Meaning even if the ""average temperature"" goes up, if you're close to the equator you will see no temperature change. This also means large swathes of areas in Russia and Canada go from being Tundra to farmable land. As in more food for the entire planet.

Plant life grows better at higher CO2 concentrations. Ideally 500-600 ppm would be where we slow down, as that will lead to better agriculture.

A glaciation period (some would call an Ice Age, even though we are in one right now) would result in vast death across the globe. Some estimate nearly a billion people would die. Meaning we should hope we are warming the planet to avoid another glaciation period.

Sea level rise has been going on for 20,000 years. And it is not accelerating. The current rate of sea level rise is 1-2mm per year. Meaning by the time populations are displaced will be over centuries, not years or even decades. Meaning humans who are good at adapting will adapt without even realizing they are doing so.

Am I correct in thinking that the primary greenhouse warming mechanism is:
- infrared photon emitted by the earth's surface strikes a CO2 molecule
- the molecule becomes more energetic and transfers it's energy to surrounding molecules via collisions 

And the secondary mechanism is:
- infrared photon emitted by the earth's surface strikes a CO2 molecule
- after some time that molecule may emit an infrared photon as a result.  
- if the direction of emission is downwards then the photon will either strike another CO2 molecule, or strike the earth's surface, warming it.

I have watched the whole thing, and those of you in the know will probably already know Dr. Christy's main points without needing to rewatch. For those who aren't and would prefer some quick bullet points:

&#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.  
 

My question is, being an average person who reads the news as well as a small number of scientific papers, what do I tell these members of my family regarding what Dr. Christy is saying in order to help move them away from this? I am aware of all the basic facts about climate change, and more or less disagree with each of these bullet points; the challenge comes in because as far as these members of my family are concerned, it is basically my word as a non-scientist against the word of a real scientist, who despite his unfortunate stance on this issue, is an incredibly experienced scientist with an extensive resume, particularly when it comes to climate. His point about all the other scientific community being essentially part of a ""conspiracy"" plays right into their hands as well. The fact of the matter too is that I simply don't have enough knowledge or evidence on hand to dispute what he's saying, other than trying to remember that one article/paper I read whenever ago and trying to dig it out and on and on.

Complete newbie looking to learn more - Really appreciate any insights.,11,Tilasir,1572479162.0,21,0.87,dpf3y9,climate_science,False,"Sorry for jumping in - I couldn't find an FAQ or newbie type of thread. Ever since I heard Greta's speech (I know she gets a lot of crap online, but it greatly impacted me and helped me start to realize the scope of the problem) I have been in a complete panic for weeks. I am only 25 and it really got me thinking about the future, whether I want a child, or if its even worth it to plan for retirement. I am absolutely horrified about what IPCC will say in 2021. I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before. To add a bit of hyperbole, this post can be reduced to: *do we need to start preparing for a collapse of society or even extinction within the next 50 years?*

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics. I would like to see if you folks have a different opinion on the following.

\- It doesn't seem like society is going to collapse by 2050 due to climate change. At least IPCC and other sources don't seem to think so.  Do you know of any reputable scientists that think collapse is a likely outcome. I've read a few articles and posts that state scientists haven't said anything because of reputation risks - do you think that is likely?

\- I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory. Forgive me, I don't have a background in science and a lot of the peer reviewed papers are too technical for my understanding. Also this recent tweet about a spike in methane:  [https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758](https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758) 

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

I was wondering if there was someone here who could help me analyse the upcoming climate changes in Scotland.

Currently, despite our rather northerly latitude, we receive temperate weather thanks to Ye Olde Jet Stream which hovers over us politely.  Otherwise we would be subject to much more intense winters a la Moscow.

Now - looking at the climate change which is cascading through our weather systems - there's a chance we would lose the jet stream - right?  It could stall or move further south.

Buuuut.  With average temps rising quickly - will we notice the loss of the jet stream as our average temps will increase anyway?  (maybe accompanied by more wild storms mind you)

Should Working Group III be a part of the IPCC?,30,naufrag,1570210865.0,12,0.98,ddaose,climate_science,False,"There has been criticism by academic commentators that IPCC working group III, dominated by economists and political scientists, bears some responsibility for the absolute failure of the global community halt the rise in CO2 emissions and respond adequately to the crisis, due to severely underplaying of the risk of damages of the climate crisis and promulgation integrated assessment models that rely on the removal of hundreds of gigatons CO2 from the atmosphere by speculative future negative emissions technologies, in order to avoid the challenging problem of real mitigation today. 

The conventional wisdom that 3.5-4C of warming somehow represents a ""cost optimal"" level of heating (for which William Nordhaus was awarded the Economics Nobel) conflicts directly with results from physical climate science - yet appears to enjoy widespread acceptance among economists.

This presentation highlights some of the foundational problems with the conventional economic approach to climate damages put forward by Nordhaus et al: Prof. Steve Keen: [Economists should be removed from the IPCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=235&v=vwwvZ8g5eHE&t=36s&fbclid=IwAR0C8IQ0xV8OZEf92IFSc9TjyDnzQRsULKm8icN7LiBMvDi7XZREHHcuBI0) The conventional economic approach is misguided, based on made-up data, and following it threatens social disaster.


Prof. Kevin Anderson has argued that [Working Group III should not be part of the IPCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BZFvc-ZOa8&t=17m22s). According to him, the large scale future reliance on negative emissions technologies by promulgated by integrated assessment modelers is a form of technocratic fraud and constitutes a moral hazard. In his estimation, they constitute a post hoc rationalization of tepid action to mitigate emissions in the present to avoid the politically unpleasant necessity of cutting CO2 emissions at a rate that would interfere with ""fairytales of economic growth""- as [Greta Thunberg recently said in her address to the UN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYqtXR8iPlE&t=35s).",True,False,False,False

A slightly older paper but a very interesting paper nevertheless, I found it doing research for my upcoming posts on geoengineering.

As the Arctic ice melts, its reflectivity or albedo will decrease. This means that the exposed ocean will warm up more as a result of increased absorption of sunlight. This causes a positive feedback loop where:

Less ice causes the ocean to warm up ---> Warmer ocean water causes more ice to melt ---> More ice gets melted ---> Rinse and repeat.

However, it was believed that this would create a possible upside. Warmer oceans would allow phytoplankton to grow. As the phytoplankton grows, it will absorb carbon dioxide and therefore cool the earth down slightly. 

This paper shows that increased phytoplankton growth could amplify Arctic warming by 20%, causing devastating warming somewhere that is already warming twice as fast as anywhere else on earth. This causes another positive feedback loop where:

Less ice causes the ocean to warm up ---> Warmer ocean water allows more phytoplankton to grow ---> More phytoplankton growth leads to warmer ocean water and therefore less ice ---> Rinse and repeat.

**Disclaimer** \-I don't want to get into debating the merits of geoengineering, this is just to get a better understanding of climate science framed in a geoengineering hyptothetical.

If Elon Musk diverted his attention from putting people on Mars to placing a relatively large controllable satellite lens or group of satellite lenses in geosynchronous orbit close to the sun (say, in the planet Mercury's orbital path):

A) how much light would these need to let pass though to offset 450 ppm CO2 warming down to 350 ppm? In other words, is there a W/M^(2) 'coefficient' from incoming long-wave radiation transfer to GHG affecting short wave radiation, averaged across the different surfaces of the earth? For example,350 is 77.77% of 450, so would this hypothetical lens need to block 22.23% of incoming solar radiation to achieve the effect of dropping from 350 ppm to 450 ppm?

B) Photosynthesis requires long spectrum radiation (blue light) that not even clouds can block. Would blocking a certain amount of this incoming light reduce plant and algae CO2 uptake enough that it would neutralize any positive benefits from preventing this light from becoming short-wave radiation on earth? Is there more incoming long spectrum radiation than plants can use per square cm of leaf surface? I realize most of this long wave radiation is reflected or absorbed as heat by the surface of the earth: this is a question of do plants get more light than they need, so that as planetary thermostat managers we could afford to block a little incoming sunlight without sacrificing too much food production, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services?

A bit of an old one, but it seems every interesting. As you all hopefully know, DMS (dimethylsulphide) essentially cools the atmosphere. DMS is produced by phytoplankton, this study shows that due to ocean acidification (OA), DMS production will decrease, causing an increase in temperature up to 0.48°C.

As you can see in the graph above my text, the trend might either be very sharp, or more shallow, a more dramatic drop might be very bad, meaning that OA will cause a large decrease in DMS and thus a boost to global warming.


This is an interesting mechanism, not included by current models.

However, the jury is still out, this paper shows that while OA will decrease DMS production, warming will increase it.

Impact of RPC on GWP,2,hippalectryon0,1565245400.0,2,1.0,cnhpqw,climate_science,False,"Edit: RCP not RPC

The GWP_N of a gas is defined as the increase in radiative forcing (RF) over N years due to the release of 1kg of that gas compared to the same increase for 1kg of CO2.^1

However, the RF for CO2, CH4 and N2O are non-linear (log for CO2, square root for CH4 and N2O). Therefore the computation of GWP should depend on the concentrations over the N years, in other words on the RCP.

Common literature/press articles uses only one value for the GWP, and I have been unable to find anything discussing the quantitative impact of RCP on GWP. Does anyone have more information ?

Is the current GHG concentration ""ahead"" or ""behind"" schedule compared to say RCP8.5, and by how much?

The reason I ask is that I'm a climate scientist specializing in local impacts for adaptation and risk assessment, and the folks who use our projections are increasingly asking about where RCP8.5 fits in terms of emissions reduction strategies and where we are at so far. I've generally viewed this question as a red herring but it's just coming up too much to not answer any more.

If you look at the values in Table 2 of [https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html) for Total Radiative Forcing they are larger than the historical numbers at [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=compare](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=compare) by about 50% in 1980.

Of course these aren't directly comparable as the NOAA paper is just converting concentrations with constants and ignoring feedbacks. So I suspect the main difference is water vapour feedback perhaps? The RCP database notes that total concentration exludes mineral dust and the effect of land albedo, however.

The difference between the two measures of total radiative forcing decreases with time and if you extrapolate from the 4 points of overlap it would be about 32% today. Applying this ratio seems to suggest that we are doing (a little bit) better in 2018 than RCP8.5 forcing by 2020 was projected to be. Does this sound about right? I had it in my head that we'd been emitting worse than RCP8.5 for quite some time now but maybe that was a few years ago and we've actually started turning away from this pathway a bit?

I've seen this website posted here before as a source of information.  After reading a reddit post on r/all about CO2 levels reaching an all time high, I started to investigate more into the issue myself (all of the top comments were saying ""we're fucked"" and ""it's too late).  I did more research into American *news* articles and a lot of them somewhat confirmed what they were saying (if we don't have a global, coordinated push we could see the collapse of society within 5 to 30 years).

I stumbled upon this site after someone posted it as a source to validate their point and the information presented in it contradicts what I've said on subs like r/science, r/worldnews, r/politics, etc.  (I'm asking this sub because the majority of commenters here seem to actually study climate).

Does this site present a reasonable/fair explanation of climate change?  I don't want to cherry-pick and believe information just because it aligns with what I want to hear (climate change is probably the biggest issue humanity is facing at the moment, but a lot of the potential effects depicted in the media are intended to ""scare"" people to act).

"Confusion over the climate change/global heating ""lag"".",17,,1561829727.0,7,0.88,c725j1,climate_science,False,"To start off I simply want to say I'm not a denier or skeptic, I fully believe that anthropogenic climate change is causing more than 100% of the current global heating and that it will have severe consequences, but I am a layman who wants to learn more.  


I've been reading about climate change for a few months and gotten a deep interest in it. However, I am confused about how the radiative forcing and temperature growth lag functions. From what I understand; Radiative forcing grows first with temperature growth following behind. It takes time for temperature growth to catch up with forcing (decades, centuries, millenia depending on TCS or ECS?).  


However, I am also having a hitch on how this functions when it comes to things such as high GWP and other atmospheric gasses. For example, as methane is initially 120x more potent than CO2 but has a very short half-life, wouldn't this practically nullify the lag for this gas and add immediate warming? Wouldn't this mean that if there was a large release of 10 GtC, wouldn't that immediately a lot of warming?  


Or things like nitrous oxide, wouldn't that practically add an immediate temperature boost without any real lag? Is there a period where a greenhouse gas absorption hits a ""peak"" before it starts degrading?

"Why did the global temperature go down by 5 degrees celcius 146M years ago when co2 went up by 50% at the same time, shouldn’t the temperature go up when CO2 goes up a lot? What factors prevented this?",11,Lambdal7,1561530842.0,8,0.68,c5meed,climate_science,False,"I saw this graphic and was wondering why CO2 often correlates inversely with temperature.

Does anyone know because of which factors 

1. Temperature went up by 8 degrees Celcius 600M years ago while co2 went down by 30%
2. Temperature went down by 8 degrees celcius while Co2 went up slighly 439M years ago
3. Temperature went up by 8 degrees while co2 didn’t move 270M years ago
4. Temperature went down by 3 degrees celcius while co2 went up by 30% 146M years ago
5. After that, temperature stayed stable for 120M years while CO2 went down

I get that CO2 traps heat, but why doesn’t it seem to correlate with temperature? Co2 only correlates with temperature once 300M years ago and 5 times it didn’t. How so?

But how are current CO2 measurements taken?  The way I see it (and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong), there are two ways to get comparable data from today.  

1) take ice core samples from the present day (1950-present), and use that as your CO2 benchmark  

2) ascertain that air samples (like ones from Mauna Loa) are equivalent to ice core samples in terms of CO2 concentration.  I imagine this could be done by letting water freeze in several chambers that vary by CO2 level, and then testing the CO2 level of the ice.  

If anyone could confirm that one of these is true, (or quell my doubt in any other way) I would appreciate it.  It doesn't strike me as trivial that the CO2 level of an ice core would necessarily be equivalent to the CO2 level of the ambient air at the time of freezing.",True,False,False,False

Currently I work in a large american investment bank and my job, though interesting in itself does not motivate me much.

I eventually want to move to Climate Science applications of data science, analyzing geographical and weather data etc. So what are the possible options to do that?

I considered going for MS but it'll be too expensive plus it may not give enough exposure to climate science methods.

Me and my SO are in the process of making a game set in a post-climate change world with the intent of guiding the player through the responsible development and use of technology to re-industrialize a dying society in a way which is mindful of, if not beneficial to, the environment.

We are crafting the base game play and scene aspects now, and are looking for resources to help us generate a quasi-realistic environment that will become the player's sandbox. To this end, we're interested in having an as-accurate-as-possible science-bassed depiction of post-climate change biodiversity & abundance (at the level of taxa), climate, weather events, etc. For instance, at the game's start, we are assuming that the landscape is quite arid, human populations are sparse and clustered along coast lines with scarce water primarily coming from rudimentary desalintors, and taxa are mostly flies, birds (which seem to suffer the least impact from CC in general) and jellyfish (which from what I understand thrive in an acidified ocean). 

Here's a vague, non-exhaustive, list of things we are interested in (keep in mind that game-play elements will be a caricature of actual effects which would take centuries if not longer IRL):

* A picture of earth after 200-300 years of unchecked climate change, specifically in North America. What is the climate, how frequent are extreme weather events and related natural disasters, etc.
* The general effects of human activities such as farming and community expansion on surrounding ecologies at the per-taxa level if possible. As an exaggerated game-play element, after improving the local region's biodiversity by replanting forests, reintroducing native species, and improving farming conditions, how is the user punished for careless resource exploitation for profit?
* How atmospheric CO2 affects plant growth and farming for the purpose of caricature (e.g. deforestation and carbon use increase local CO2 -- survivable crops then develop more foliage, but not more nutrition, at the expense of high nitrogen consumption and increased water requirements)
* Loss of native plant species due to climate driven invasion, effective management strategies for invasive plants.
* Microbial biodiversity changes + effects up the food chain
* Climate driven effects on viral and bacterial epidemics in mammals, crops



Unfortunately, neither of us are experts in climate science and are unfamiliar with the major predictions of the accepted literature. We would like any references that might help to inform us, even if they are technical. I am a condensed matter physics Ph.D with some knowledge of mathematical ecology and evolutionary dynamics and he is a Biophysics Ph.D. with experience in development and population genetics with an emphasis on mathematics and computation, so between us we should be able to dissect technical reviews. We also have pay-wall access to the standard journals.

If anyone has a go-to list that would acquaint us with the major points, or favorite forecasting papers, we would be super excited about it. Also if anyone is willing to let us spam them questions occasionally in exchange for a mention in our game, or a character/item or something named after you, that would be awesome too!

Which is fine in a stable climate system as weather patterns will have seasonal rates and models that mimic those patterns and rates will be able to simulate quite accurately what is going on.

another article https://www.eticasgr.com/storie/news-eventi/cambiamento-climatico-riscaldamento-globale) instead says that although there are atrocious scenarios there will not be the end of the world by 2050.

now I want the REALISTIC analysis (not optimistic, not pessimistic, REALISTIC) regarding the path we are CURRENTLY taking towards global warming, when we realistically reach 2 degrees and the forecasts of the consequences of what it will have.
because I heard some users say that now even the WORST scenario is too realistic because things like ""the Amazon forest which has become positive for carbon dioxide and is therefore dying quickly"" have not been included in the calculations so humanity could end really by 2050.

My new video… Our Unravelling Civilization… root cause: abrupt climate system mayhem … accelerant: war,19,paulhenrybeckwith,1697046968.0,2,0.82,175keto,climate,False,"This video is about the big picture of our unravelling civilization. 

Ever increasing numbers of men, woman, and children are dying from extreme weather disruption consequences of our angry planet undergoing abrupt climate system mayhem. 

Many other humans, or rather “human animals”, according to the Israeli defence minister are being deliberately killed by bombs fired and dropped by angry people against other angry people. 

As soon as a government dehumanizes other people, they are setting up conditions for genocide on a large scale. Does Israel really mean to kill over 2 million people in the Gaza Strip. Yes? No? If no, then how many will satisfy their blood lust? 50,000? 100,000? What Palestinian to Israeli death ratio are they aiming for? What ratio will cause a northern attack on Israel? What ratio will cause other Arab countries in the Middle East to enter the fray? What ratio will cause Iran to fight? What ratio will satisfy the US and other western countries, and have them suddenly pivot from supporting genocidal massacre to becoming humanitarians? Lots of questions. I guess we will experience some answers over the coming weeks.

Do the math. Without water, people die after a few days. Without food they wither away; just look at the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland. Without electricity, people are thrust back into the dark ages. When these poor souls are enclosed by a fence, with no ability to leave via land or sea, and are bombarded by one of the most powerful militaries the world has ever seen, and backed with unwavering  support from the US, Canada, and other western powers expect a Gaza Holocaust. A Gaza Genocide. A Gaza Apartheid. 

We can no longer assume that cities knocked over today, whether it be by floods, superstorms, wildfire incineration, derechos, or wars, will ever be rebuilt. Even western cities like New York (remember Sandy) or New Orleans (remember Katrina); in fact every place in the world are not without risk.

If you live in a nice house, in a nice neighbourhood, in a nice city and country anywhere on the planet count your blessings. Do not assume permanence. It does not take much to have everything you know turned to dust and ruin in the blink of an eye. 

When there is no longer any money or materials to rebuild destroyed places, people will move to other places. Over time, there becomes fewer of these “other places”. In fact, vast regions of our planet will be rendered completely uninhabitable by heat and drought. 

Civilizations around the planet are in rapid decline, and collapse occurs as “death by a thousand cuts”, not all at once, simultaneously. Anyone with open eyes and half a brain can see that happening, before their very eyes, today.

Our climate system is lurching uncontrollably towards a world of Heaviside Functions. In most climate parameters, including global temperature. 

Within this video, as I stroll about in nature with free-rein Newton, I called it “Delta Function” behaviour, but mathematical delta functions are really singularity spikes that in an instant go up to infinity and then in the next instant go back to zero. More accurate is Heaviside function behaviour where we shoot upwards in an instant, and then stay up. That is where we are headed. 

Last video I went through the must-read report by the OECD on tipping points, and this video I chat about some of my own additional thoughts.

A likely scenario is further slowing or shutdown of AMOC (even a slowdown seems like it may be enough) to topple the Earth system apple-cart. The ITCZ shifts southward so it essentially stops raining in Europe and in the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon burns out, to be quickly replaced by savannah. Maybe new tropical forests set up further south in South America. We lose between 1/2 and 2/3 of our grains and maize growing regions. Indian Monsoon rainfall drops by half. Short term, the northern hemisphere cools, and dries, but the southern hemisphere bakes, Antarctic sea ice collapses (even more), and West Antarctic Ice melt shoots upwards. 

I’m just getting started. Instead of me typing more and you reading more, you’ll just have to watch the video.

"My new video: Increased Rainfall over Greenland by 33% Means Less Snowfall and Thus Less Snowfall for Accumulation. Basically, less ice is being formed in Accumulation regions from less compressed snowfall… Bad for ice mass balance on Greenland",7,paulhenrybeckwith,1696360011.0,2,0.89,16z0hl5,climate,False,"A very comprehensive and significant peer reviewed scientific study shows that over the period of time from 1991 to 2021 there has been an increase of rainfall over the massive ice sheets on Greenland and a corresponding decrease in the snowfall that over time gets compressed into firn and then accumulates as new ice on the ice sheet. 

Thus, not only is the Greenland ice ablating, and thinning, and calving at increased rates, but less snow is falling to cause ice accumulation, since more of the precipitation is falling as rainfall instead of snowfall.

Not only that, but we are seeing an increasing number of so-called Atmospheric River Events (ARs) reaching over the Greenland Ice as the jet stream slows down and the north-south jet stream waves are amplified. More and more of these warm, moisture laden atmospheric rivers are causing torrential rain events over Greenland, where more than 300 mm of rain falls in a single day, even at very high altitudes on the ice sheet. This warm rainfall further ablates the ice sheet and runs down into crevices and moulins and accelerates glacial flow rates. Also, these atmospheric rivers are filamenting into fingers of extremely high water content updrafts (called “rapids” in the paper; poor name choice in my view) that wind their way up the valleys of the combined land-glacier orography (topography) reaching very high elevations on the ice sheet (even up to 1.5 km) where rainfall is generated over areas that have previously been accumulation regions generating new ice on the glacier over time from compressed accumulated snowfall.

All in all, we can expect ever increasing ice mass loss in Greenland as abrupt climate change accelerated, with a corresponding acceleration of global sea level rise. Also, as Arctic Sea Ice continues to decline, we can expect accelerating coastal ice shelf collapse and then a corresponding acceleration in the glacial flow rate of the massive, on-land ice sheets. 

Not a pretty picture; the devil is always in the details and this paper provides many of these details for accelerating Greenland ice-mass loss.

James Hansen is arguably the giant of all climate scientists. I was very fortunate to meet him a few years ago at a COP climate conference, and chat with him on a CEF (Climate Emergency Forum) video. 

He has just published a new paper on updates on the climate system: http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2023/FlyingBlind.14September2023.pdf

About a month ago, I covered his August 14th paper, and this video is an update on his newest stuff.

This paper is vitally important in giving us a clear picture of what we can expect in the next few years.

A confluence of factors is driving up global average temperatures of the atmosphere and oceans and we can expect warming and climate extremes to notch up to much higher record setting levels. 

We ain’t seen nothing yet. We are only getting a taste this summer of what is to come in the next year or two.

1) Average global temperatures trended upwards at 0.18 degrees C per decade before 2010. With less aerosol forcing, since 2010 to now it has risen between 0.27 and 0.36 degrees C (this was all in the previous paper “Global Warming in the Pipeline”)

2) We can expect an additional rise from El Niño; it is really just getting started. A super El Niño will easily drive global average temperatures well above 1.5 C perhaps later this year but highly probably for the first six months of 2024. El Niño is much more powerfully warming the planet in the year after it starts, so in 2024 since it started this year. 

3) Solar irradiation is peaking soon, and basically adds a forcing of +0.1 W per m**2 on top of everything else.

4) We are missing a vast area of sea ice around Antarctica, but Antarctica is still in its winter darkness. Come Fall and Winter for Northern Hemisphere dwellers, the sun rises in the Southern Hemisphere and the huge extra area of dark open ocean around Antarctica will absorb huge amounts of extra sunlight.

5) The Earth Energy Imbalance was 0.6 W or m**2 ten years ago (400,000 Hiroshima bombs a day) but is now 1.22 W per m**2 (more than double; namely 800,000 Hiroshima bombs per day); the most recent value is a staggering 1.46 W per m**2.

6) By May of 2024, it looks increasing likely (almost certain) that the 12 month average global temperature will exceed 1.5C, with the monthly value close to 1.8C or maybe even as high as 2C.

It is already rapidly rising and the additional effects listed above will greatly accelerate the rise. 

As a result of this unfortunate confluence of events, we can expect the global climate turmoil in the last few months to substantially worsen. When it does, expect the media and mainstream scientists and politicians to espouse their excuses and concerns, but none of that matters if they do not slash fossil fuels. 

Last month Lahaina in Hawaii was incinerated and many people are still missing (I think they have returned to ashes and dust), and also 90-95% of the town of Enterprise in Canada’s Northwest Territories was incinerated. Global floods are ongoing (look at the inundation of NYC a few days ago), heatwaves are killing countless people, and global governments just don’t give a damn, since they are subsidizing fossil fuels at record high levels of 7.1 Trillion Dollars per year.

And the world goes on, at least for most people.

The results are very sobering, or at least they should be, but they probably won’t be. With Business-As-Usual, burning fossil fuels must essentially be considered manslaughter, of mostly poor people in the future by richer people today.

Basically, when we burn fossil fuels and create another trillion tons of CO2 emissions, and the global average temperature rises above 2C we can expect roughly a billion humans to die, so the simple math means that one future life is killed per 1000 tons of carbon.

It is hard to visualize 1000 tons of CO2, or even 1 ton of CO2, since this gas is invisible to the human eyes. I show you some interesting visualizations of how much 1 ton is (basically a 10 meter diameter sphere), and how a days emissions in a place like New York City dwarf and bury the Empire State Building.

When people talk about what could be the solution for carbon emissions the first solution discussed is renewable energies but this past summer i heard someone, that has a photovoltaic panel at home, wonder about just blasting the AC during the day to have the house colder at night  based on the energy being produced during the day not being consumed. Of course money wise its a good idea, but it’s an environmental atrocity. You are overusing a panel and a AC unit that have to be manufactured with special materials that have to be mined plus gases etc… etc… This situation makes me wonder how can we prove that going carbon neutral will not just create another unpredictable issue on each renewable. Aren’t we just worried about carbon (because of rising temperature) but changing to something else will create other problems.

Currently, we are transitioning from an ice age back to the planet's normal state. The Jurassic period, which lasted an astounding 56 million years, experienced prolonged elevated temperatures. This raises the question: Why do we consider today's temperature to be the correct one? It is crucial not to be swayed solely by the sensational tactics employed in climate discussions.

I can’t seem to find any coverage on this anywhere.

Of course, maybe it’s the pandemic but I’m just worried if it’s actually the suppression of media coverage similar to August 2019. But here’s what I could find:

During the Amazon Country Summit on August 28, 2019, it was announced that the countries sharing the Amazon rainforest, excluding Venezuela, will hold a summit in Colombia on September 6, 2019, to discuss the ongoing Amazon fire situation. Which led to the involved countries signing a pact to coordinate monitoring of the Amazon forest and disaster response, and a better information network to coordinate their responses.

(Paraphrased &amp; summarised from the [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Amazon_rainforest_wildfires))

However, no further news other than when Brazilian President, Jail Bolsonaro [scaled back on efforts to fight illegal logging, mining and farming,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/world/americas/brazil-amazon-deforestation.html) which have led to widespread destruction of the Amazon Rainforest (again)

I Googled “Amazon Wildfire 2020” and set the search settings to show me articles from this year and only found 6 of them.

I know we’re in a pandemic right now with this outbreak getting worse but I’m concerned for the lack of media coverage on this topic especially considering how President Jair Bolsonaro backed out from his conservation efforts and went ahead with continuing the deforestation of the Amazon.

Ten hottest years on record: not exactly forever ago,14,24-cell,1579999906.0,0,0.86,etzkf8,GlobalClimateChange,False,"The data is in from NASA and NOAA, and 2019 was the second hottest year on record, measurements taken by land and ocean surface temperatures combined. Both agencies put 2019 in second place below 2016, when a strong El Niño took place.

In early 2015, NASA posted [this](https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/2224/) article about the ten hottest years on record at the time, and briefly reviewed a world event from that year. The purpose of this is to get people to see the hottest years not just as numbers but to associate them with events. This helps people understand just how recent these years are- anyone out of high school can easily remember them.

I want to do the same thing now, so here are the ten hottest years on record according to an average of NASA and NOAA data, with an event associated. I'm pretty sure the original NASA article only used its own data and it's been updated, so some years on that page may be flipped around here. The events for 2010, 2009, and 2005 were taken directly from that page. (And I've also posted this on a few other forums.)

&#x200B;

**1. 2016 - Louisiana flooding**

 In August of the hottest year ever recorded, catastrophic floods devastated southern Louisiana and submerged thousands of buildings. Governor Edwards declared a state of emergency and called the flooding historic and unprecedented. Many scientists believe climate change will make these events in Louisiana more common in the future. 

**2. 2019 - Australian bush fires**

 In late 2019, the 2019-20 bush fire season began in Australia, and it is the worst bush fire season in Australia since at least 1974. 2019 was also the hottest and driest year on record in Australia, and there is a drying trend in Australia around the regions of the bush fires. Dryer and hotter conditions are more favorable for bush fires, and climate change will likely make these events more common in the future. 

**3. 2017 - Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria**

 2017 had an extremely active and dangerous hurricane season in the Atlantic. Harvey was the costliest hurricane on record and produced catastrophic floods in Texas. Irma caused a lot of destruction in the Caribbean as well as Maria, which left parts of Puerto Rico without electricity for months. It is currently unclear if climate change is changing, or will change, hurricane frequencies or intensities. 

**3. 2015 - Paris Climate Conference**

 In December 2015, 196 countries from around the world met in Paris to set a plan to keep global temperatures below the famous 2C limit relative to pre-industrial temperatures. An agreement was made and ratified, but there are no enforcement mechanisms, and a few world leaders of carbon-intensive countries since then have said they want to exit the agreement. 

**5. 2018 - Eruption of Anak Krakatoa volcano**

 The Anak Krakatoa volcano between the Java and Sumatra islands in Indonesia erupted on 22 December 2018 which then triggered a deadly tsunami, killing about 400 people and injuring 14,000 others. It is so far the deadliest volcano eruption of the 21st century. 

**6. 2014 - Ebola outbreak**

 In 2014, there was an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Liberia which spread to neighboring countries, and the World Health Organization declared an emergency on 8 August. The outbreak lasted until mid-2016 and infected roughly 30,000 people, of which about 40% died. 

**7. 2010 - BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico**

 The Gulf of Mexico oil spill began on April 20, 2010. It lasted 87 days and spewed about 260 million gallons of crude oil into the ocean, making it the worst marine oil spill in history. Eleven people and countless marine animals were killed. 

**8. 2013 - Snowden leaks of Global Surveillance**

 In June 2013, CIA employee Edward Snowden leaked thousands of classified documents from the NSA, revealing extensive global surveillance of hundreds of millions of people, looking through things such as phone calls and internet history. To avoid prosecution by the U.S. government for leaking classified information, Snowden fled to Russia, where he resides today. 

**8. 2005 - Hurricane Katrina**

 Hurricane Katrina formed in the Bahamas on August 23, 2005 and made landfall on August 29, causing flooding and severe destruction along the Gulf Coast. New Orleans, Louisiana, was especially hit hard when levee failure caused over 80 percent of the city to become inundated. 

**10. 2009 - Copenhagen Climate Conference** 

 The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference was held in Copenhagen December 7-18, 2009.

As sea levels rise and the fierce cyclones, the salinity intrusion into coastal areas, impacting the lives of millions of residents of Bangladesh.

Around [35 million people are living on the edge of a climate catastrophe](http://www.zulkernaeen.com/exclusive-report/salinity-intrusion-coastal-bangladesh/), at the coastal belt of the Bay of Bengal.

We often spoke about the immediate impacts of storms and tidal upsurges. But we hear less about the [resulting salinity increase and its long-term consequences](https://www.eurasiareview.com/30042018-a-harsh-reality-of-bangladesh-water-security-salinity-intrusion-and-internal-migration-oped/). Each time saltwater from the sea contaminates farms and water sources when a tidal surge sweeps the inland.  Along with drastic economic effects, as its consequences, worsening of crop yields, malnutrition, and diseases are significant concerns. 

>!Nearly 98% of freshwater reservoirs and ecosystem is lost.!<

As consequences, high and long-term salinity exposure has deteriorated the coastal lifestyle and acute health crises.

The salinity gradients in groundwater increased several-fold over previous decades. A significant change is observed in the salinity of the groundwater aquifer over the last ten years. The salt content is at its highest level during the summer season.  

>!45% of people drink pond water without taking any disinfection measures.  !<

Here, life is so miserable when access to fresh drinking water. That is why local people can't regularly drink enough water to meet their bodies ' demands owing to severe drinking water shortages. 

Unfortunately, the average potable water collection time takes around four hours a day. Moreover, around 45% of people use pond water for drinking without taking any disinfection measures. 

>!Not enough money to get treatment for their disease. !<

The long-term consequences of the regional water crisis cause residents suffering from high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases, a high prevalence of kidney diseases, skin diseases, and diarrhoea. Also, the average household health expenditure is high. 

Thus, more than 95% of residents do not get proper treatment because of high treatment costs and lack of medical support at the community level.

>!First food, then treatment.!<

Despite having no adequate money to meet the regular household needs, their average health treatment cost has increased by around 24%. So, most low-income people try to ignore their health diseases owing to food insecurity and financial crisis. It leads to a thought process of ""first food, then treatment.""",True,False,False,False

I ask because I tried to find out about this but didn't get a definitive answer: I only got 2 articles: one article(https://amp24.ilsole24ore.com/pagina/ACxDIjU) says that human civilization will literally DISAPPEAR by 2050 as global warming will even exceed 3 degrees because in addition to industrial climate warming there will be an acceleration due to the fact that too many pressure points have been passed and global warming is now self-sustaining and two billion people will die of hunger and there will be billions of climate refugees.

another article instead(https://www.eticasgr.com/storie/news-eventi/cambiamento-climatico-riscaldamento-globale) says that although there are atrocious scenarios there will not be the end of the world by 2050.

now I want the REALISTIC analysis (not optimistic, not pessimistic, REALISTIC) regarding the path we are CURRENTLY taking towards global warming, when we realistically reach 2 degrees and the forecasts of the consequences of what it will have.
because I heard some users say that now even the WORST scenario is too realistic because things like ""the Amazon forest which has become positive for carbon dioxide and is therefore dying quickly"" have not been included in the calculations so humanity could end really by 2050.

Solar and wind are better than nuclear,22,Consistent_Piano_210,1698005642.0,44,0.68,17e251o,climatechange,False,"Taken from a discussion:

Nickel Iron batteries do last for more than 100 years.  They can be easily repaired (after 100 years plus of use), if they need to be, by a layperson, for continued use thereafter.  

Wind turbines consist of components that can ALL be repaired, refurbished, re-used, or recycled.  Specifically wind turbines consist of the blades to catch the wind, a gear and rod system, a motor/generator (stator and rotor, consisting of repairable, refurbishable, or easily re-usable or recyclable materials).  Solar panels can be refurbished.  Lets consider all of the materials used in solar panels minus the photovoltaic cells first.  They can all be re-used or recycled.  Spent photovoltaic cells have begun to be refurbished and recycled as well.

Nuclear reactor waste release radiation for hundreds of millions of years.  This is a permanent positive rate of damage to surrounding life on Earth.  This is well known.  Not to mention that accidents (which would be minor in any other case) are catastrophic to the extreme.  See the Marshall Islands, Fukushima, etc.  Nuclear reactors are a HUGE liability.

Nuclear has literally double to triple the cost to build compared to solar or wind.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#Capital_costs

If you install a complete solar panel and battery system yourself to get off the grid, you get a variable return on investment, that increases exponentially with how little you spend a month on electricity.  This asymptotes at about 14% as the amount spent on electricity goes up, and increases to infinity as you spend less on electricity per month.  If you spend very little on electricity, using all the most efficient appliances you can get, you'll likely get a 100-200% return on your investment.  This assumes 8 hours of sunlight per day.

Again, Nickel Iron batteries have an even higher return on investment than the best batteries in common use today (LiFePh).  They are relatively simple to build, and they are incredibly clean for battery technology.  If production were scaled up, their price would fall by more than half.

In comparison, if you get consistent 14mph winds, wind turbines cost a QUARTER of what solar panels cost to produce the same amount of electricity (watts).

These technologies OBVIOUSLY do not need government subsidies to be viable.  A 14% return on investment (the lowest possible ROI on solar panels assuming 8 hours of sun a day, and installing them yourself) is objectively worth the cost.  A 30%, 100%, 200% ROI is a what might be meet the technical standards of the term, ""a no-brainer"".  Even a 14% ROI would be a no-brainer for someone with a basic knowledge of the concept of investment.

Compared to solar and wind, the initial cost of a nuclear plant per watt generated is literally 2-3x as much to build.  That means that per dollar, you can get 2-3x as many watts from solar panels and wind, including the battery system to provide electricity during down-times.

Sure there are places that don't get sun or wind, and it's worth it to have the capability of building a nuclear plant in your toolbelt, but people should be cognizant and acknowledge the facts, and optimize the use of limited funding, workforce, and resources in general, when building electricity production facilities.  Nuclear is an objectively sub-par option in the vast majority of cases, and an objectively horrible option in many cases.

Solar and wind also have a lot more room for improvement compared to nuclear, in terms of efficiency.  Solar and wind have the potential to be improved by 800%, compared to only 6% with nuclear, in terms of efficient capture of energy.  (See the CF rating in the Wikipedia link above.)

How a sticky self-concept prevents us from acknowledging climate change,22,EducatedGuessStack,1697995944.0,34,0.93,17dyk6u,climatechange,False,"Hey all, I'm a neuroscientist and psychologist trying to use science to make sense of society.

Ok, I'll reply. I really don't need to have academia tell me anything about Anthropogenic Climate Change. All that I need to do is look and see. I live in California. I know, I know get it all out... Here in California we have a thing called Atmospheric Rivers that occasionally happened and usually happened when an El Nino or Nina what occur. El Ninos and Ninas had a cycle. Every 3 to 5 years one would occur. They don't anymore. They're still called El Nino or Nina but they are something different and the cycle is different. There isn't one. When I heard on our local news that it may be another El whatever and it ""petered out"" and didn't occur then WTF? NOAA wanted to start categorizing Atmospheric Rivers because of their rising frequency. Back to Back slamming the Sierras. Took So Cal out of a 20 year drought in a 2yrs. Before NOAA starting to categorize atmospheric rivers they didn't care about it because it was infrequent and they just didn't care. They do now.

I remember in the late 80's David Suzuki had a 3hr special on PBS called Global Warming. It was about three of the biggest CRAY supercomputers. They were at some university in CA (UCLA?), a Japanese Corporation and in Britain somewhere. Three different places that had at the time the biggest computers. All three were independently trying to look in to the future and create a model for what earth will look like in X amount of years. If there was a trend and how would that look like. It took years because any small variance or slight difference in data changed the outcome drastically. The biggest stumbling block for them at the end was, of all things, clouds. How did clouds work with heat and radiation bouncing, absorbed and or reflecting. They didn't know and it was complex. They finally had what they thought was the best data to plug in to the supercomputers. I forgot which one was the best or had the biggest computer array but one came up with the best ""outlook"". Sea level rising and taking away The Keys, The Barrier Islands, Parts of Boston, Parts of the California Coast all the way up to Alaska, New York City doesn't fair well either. High winds, tornadoes, floods slamming the Midwest then excessive heat destroying our ""bread basket"". The Great Lakes dumping down into the Mississippi causing massive flooding. Greater and more frequent hurricanes up the Eastern Seaboard. Greater and more frequent tornadoes ripping through tornado alley.

It was fucked up other than CA becoming more tropical, which it is, because I like the tropics. Anyhow, this was predicted in the 80's. Oil corporations knew about how bad burning things in order to propel ourselves was bad for us in the 70's but probably before that. The 50's.

It was perplexing to me that you can see Grammy get hit in the face with a 2x4 and the last thing she tastes is her own blood and not think something is wrong. When the third category holy fucking shit hits your second beach house and obliterates it...something seems wrong.

My favorite is, ""it's God's will"". I just don't have the time or bandwidth patience to even try with that. However, ""it's just normal earth cycles"" just seems either you/they are stuck in a bubble of buddies, family, maybe small town that doesn't allow for researching or just willfully ignorant.

There is a third thing though. This explains to some extent how smart and articulate people can deny climate change that is HUMAN CAUSED. This is what a BILLION dollars buys you...

Why is the climate change cost in terms of GDP relatively low in the current white house and IPCC reports,9,badhoccyr,1697498825.0,43,0.72,179k1l6,climatechange,False,"The white house has a report from this year, as well as last year and there's an IPCC report  on the actual cost of climate chagne. They all line up more or less. Basically even if we end up with 3 degrees the cost of climate change by 2100 will be still less than 1% of GDP annually if i understand correctly. Transitioning with current tech will cost at minimum 5% annually from what i understand. Now that is US based, while the IPCC is a global estimate. Maybe either way the cost would need to be subsidized by the developed world.

There's several things the IPCC has anything more than medium confidence on. Ecological droughts (not any other type of drought), extreme heat, mean air temperature, cold spells, permafrost, lake river and sea ice, mean ocean temperature, ocean salinity, dissolved oxygen, atmospheric CO2 at surface

Ecological droughts can be solved with desalination, we'd realistcally need to help other countries finance it tough. Desalination is used at mass scale already, ie, gulf states, israel, california

We don't have actual food shortages except from a distribution point of view and our yields are going up at a mind boggling rate from continued tech advances in agri tech.

I do not understand the damage of ocean temp, salinity, and dissolved oxygen well, i'd welcome someone chiming in here. Maybe this wouldn't factor well into the GDP cost as seafood is a minority in calories per capita, 7-8 percent roughly. Would we lose a lot of biodiversity in the Oceans?

As far as cold spells and extreme heat events, it is energy that solves this for us. However, once again any other species that does not own Air conditioner is disrupted. How bad is this?

As far as humans, it is energy that keeps people from freezing to death or overheating to death. In the poorest countries they are very price sensitive and the cost of energy can mean life and death for the poorest of us. If we penalize the supply chain of fossil fuels too much we have high energy prices that affect people severely in developing nations, can cause geopolitical instability and could lead to more war as in a tight energy market we have less ability to sanction.

I'd like to test a point a view to be debated on that disrupting civilization by going too fast or in a way that's too penalizing could cost more than 1% and that ""cost"" in both scenarios do incorporate human suffering, what are your thoughts? However, would we still want to make that trade-off for all the reasons that don't get represented well in GDP cost, like loss of biodiversity for example, and what are those costs that are not represented in the GPD cost?

We should obviously do this with urgency. But is there a level where it actually becomes more harmful to us? Also how do we do it? I'm particularly interested how we do it if nuclear is off the table?

Why not nuclear power pt. 2,38,NoAstronaut4900,1697384180.0,199,0.73,178hz3g,climatechange,False,"Hi, I posted the original response a few days ago here and have read through many responses. Many people had sensible posts that were not overly mean or cynical. Thank you.

Overall, I feel that I was wrong that nuclear power is our only option and people made some great arguments for and against it.

Here is my big takeaway. Mathematically speaking, it doesn’t make sense to invest heavily in *new* nuclear plants. The cost and time, even for newer generation models, still greatly exceeds other renewable, such as solar and wind. There is just more energy return on investment with solar and wind.

Additionally, the carbon output is takes to build a plant is so great it would take years until the plant off sets there original co2 emissions. There is also always the problem of nuclear waste.

The path forward seems to look something like this:

1. Heavily invest in R&D and construction of solar, wind, and geothermal energy sources. 
2. Update the electrical grid to help the flow of clean energy sources.
3. Invest in energy storage
4. Keep existing, functional nuclear plants operating.
5. Continue to convert all engines that run on fossil fuels to electrical powered. 
6. Reduce energy usage (although this seems least likely to change since it requires the population to change their habits)

Obviously, this is super simplified and a someone posted a great link an IEA that gives a lot of helpful information about a path forward. Check it out here.

Staggering. Unnerving. Mind-boggling. Absolutely gobsmackingly bananas.

As global temperatures shattered records and reached dangerous new highs over and over the past few months, my climate scientist colleagues and I [have](https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins/status/1709825752705753105) just about run out of adjectives to describe what we have seen. Data from [Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/september-2023-temperature-update/) released on Wednesday shows that September was an astounding 0.5 degree Celsius (almost a full degree Fahrenheit) hotter than the prior record, and July and [August](https://berkeleyearth.org/august-2023-temperature-update/) were around 0.3 degree Celsius (0.5 degree Fahrenheit) hotter. 2023 is almost certain to be the hottest year since reliable global records began in the mid-1800s and probably for the [past 2,000 years](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0400-0) (and [well before that](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/july-2023-is-hottest-month-ever-recorded-on-earth/)).

While natural weather patterns, including a [growing El Niño event](https://iri.columbia.edu/our-expertise/climate/forecasts/enso/current/), are playing an important role, the record global temperatures we have experienced this year could not have occurred without the approximately 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) of [warming to date](https://climatechangetracker.org/igcc) from human sources of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. And while many experts have been cautious about acknowledging it, there is increasing evidence that global warming has accelerated over the past 15 years rather than continued at a gradual, steady pace. That acceleration means that the effects of climate change we are already seeing — extreme heat waves, wildfires, rainfall and sea level rise — will only grow more severe in the coming years.

I don’t make this claim lightly. Among my colleagues in climate science, there are sharp divisions on this question, and [some](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2023/07/23/climate-crisis-warming-is-right-in-line-with-early-predictions-but-many-of-the-impacts-are-exceeding-predictions_6063986_114.html) aren’t convinced it’s happening. Climate scientists generally focus on longer-term changes over decades rather than year-to-year variability, and some of my peers in the field have expressed concerns about overinterpreting short-term events like the extremes we’ve seen this year. In the past I doubted acceleration was happening, in part because of a long debate about whether global warming had paused from 1998 to 2012. In hindsight, that was [clearly not the case](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22315). I’m worried that if we don’t pay attention today, we’ll miss what are increasingly clear signals.

I wouldn’t be making this argument if I didn’t have strong evidence to back it up; the data we’re getting from three sources tells a worrying story about a world warming more quickly than before. First, the rate of warming we’ve measured over the world’s land and oceans over the past 15 years has been 40 percent higher than the rate since the 1970s, with the past nine years being the nine warmest years on record. Second, there has been [acceleration](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/35/14/JCLI-D-21-0895.1.xml) over the past few decades in the total heat content of Earth’s oceans, where over 90 percent of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is accumulating. Third, [satellite measurements](https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/science/) of Earth’s energy imbalance — the difference between energy entering the atmosphere from the sun and the amount of heat leaving — show [a strong increase](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/essd-15-2295-2023.html) in the amount of heat trapped over the past two decades. If Earth’s energy imbalance is increasing over time, it should drive an increase in the world’s rate of warming.

There are a number of factors driving the acceleration of warming. While the world has [made real progress](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/10/25/climate/world-climate-pledges-cop26.html) in slowing down the growth of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, they have yet to peak and decline. And on top of this, we are reaping the results of what the climate scientist James Hansen [calls](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/opinion/columnists/the-faustian-bargain-of-reducing-air-pollution.html) our “Faustian bargain” with air pollution. For decades, air pollution from sulfur dioxide and other hazardous substances in fossil fuels has had a strong temporary cooling effect on our climate. But as countries around the world have begun to clean up the air, the cooling effect provided by these aerosols has [fallen by around 30 percent](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/essd-15-2295-2023.html) since 2000. Aerosols have fallen even more in the past three years, after a decision to largely [phase out sulfur](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-low-sulphur-shipping-rules-are-affecting-global-warming/) in marine fuels in 2020. These reductions in pollution on top of continued increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations mean that we are encountering some of the unvarnished force of climate change for the first time.

Until recently, climate change was framed as an issue that would affect our children. Today it is nearly omnipresent, and it is impossible to ignore. And very soon, with the acceleration, we will experience even more of its effects: Ice sheets and glaciers will melt faster, extreme weather events will become more frequent, and even more plants and animals will be put at risk of extinction.

Does this acceleration mean that warming is happening faster than we thought or that it is too late to avoid the worst impacts? Not necessarily. Amazingly enough, this acceleration quite closely matches [what climate models have](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4/) projected for this period. In other words, scientists have long foreseen a possible acceleration of warming if our aerosol emissions declined while our greenhouse gas emissions did not. That’s what we’re now seeing. This may not make you feel much better about the future of warming but should at least make you feel better about our models and the power of science to prepare us for what’s to come.

It’s now clear that we can control how warm the planet gets over the coming decades. Climate models have [consistently found](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached/) that once we get emissions down to net zero, the world will largely stop warming; there is no warming that is inevitable or [in the pipeline](https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/warming-in-the-pipeline-decoding) after that point. Of course, the world will not cool back down for many centuries, unless world powers join in major efforts [to remove](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-what-the-new-ipcc-report-says-about-how-to-limit-warming-to-1-5c-or-2c/) more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than we add. But that is the brutal math of climate change and the reason we need to speed up efforts to reduce emissions significantly.

On that front, there is some reason for [cautious hope](https://swac.umn.edu/events/kuehnast-lecture-2022). The world is on the brink of a clean energy transition. The International Energy Agency [recently estimated](https://www.iea.org/news/the-path-to-limiting-global-warming-to-1-5-c-has-narrowed-but-clean-energy-growth-is-keeping-it-open) that a whopping $1.8 trillion will be invested in clean energy technologies like renewables, electric cars and heat pumps in 2023, up from [roughly $300 billion](https://about.bnef.com/blog/global-low-carbon-energy-technology-investment-surges-past-1-trillion-for-the-first-time/) a decade ago. Prices of solar, wind and batteries have plummeted over the past 15 years, and for much of the world, solar power is now the [cheapest form of electricity](https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea/). If we reduce emissions quickly, we can switch from a world in which warming is accelerating to one in which it’s slowing. Eventually, we can stop it entirely.

We are far from on track to meet our climate goals, and much more work remains. But the positive steps we’ve made over the past decade should reinforce to us that progress is possible and despair is counterproductive. Despite the recent acceleration of warming, humans remain firmly in the driver’s seat, and the future of our climate is still up to us to decide.

Abstract:

>Antarctic ice shelves moderate the contribution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to global sea level rise; however, ice shelf health remains poorly constrained. Here, we present the annual mass budget of all Antarctic ice shelves from 1997 to 2021. Out of 162 ice shelves, 71 lost mass, 29 gained mass, and 62 did not change mass significantly. Of the shelves that lost mass, 68 had statistically significant negative mass trends, 48 lost more than 30% of their initial mass, and basal melting was the dominant contributor to that mass loss at a majority (68%). At many ice shelves, mass losses due to basal melting or iceberg calving were significantly positively correlated with grounding line discharge anomalies; however, the strength and form of this relationship varied substantially between ice shelves. Our results illustrate the utility of partitioning high-resolution ice shelf mass balance observations into its components to quantify the contributors to ice shelf mass change and the response of grounded ice.

New Study Finds Ontario Wind Projects Are Facing Significant Opposition by Energy-Privileged Communities,37,screamingpika,1697116219.0,11,0.89,1766mhh,climatechange,False,"A new study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that 17% and 18% of wind projects in the United States and Canada, respectively, faced local opposition from 2000-2016. Over this period, wind projects met increasing opposition rates, with pushback tending to be regionally focused in the Northeastern United States and Ontario. 

The study found that opposition in Canada was carried out primarily, and with the most intensity, in wealthier communities, using tactics such as court cases, legislation, and physical protests. While opposition numbers are not high, with approximately 34 Canadians engaging in protests on average, these demonstrations are enough to slow down the transition away from fossil fuels, resulting in an environmental injustice the authors of the study refer to as “energy privilege”.",False,False,False,False

What is you opinion about how climate scientists are using social media?,28,carlitos_sagan,1696603833.0,90,0.83,171eb9m,climatechange,False,"I'm a regular on Twitter - I know, not exactly a bragging point - and I often see climate scientists posting their latest findings and speculating on what they could mean. I get that they may be doing this with the best of intentions and almost as a cry for help to be heard, but I'm not sure it's working. Here's why:

1. When scientists share new findings with the general public, who aren't climate experts, it often leads to confusion because there can be a ton of expert views on the same discovery. Don't you think it'd be smarter to hash out these discoveries within academic circles until there's a common ground or better understanding, instead of tossing out initial data to the public and jumping to conclusions?

2. A lot of these posts are really intense, full of doom and gloom. This can make people feel helpless, especially those who are worried about the climate crisis. Some scientists are even saying we've crossed a point of no return, predicting a dystopian Mad Max-style future by the century's end, if not sooner. To me, that feels reckless. Yes, the situation is serious, but there are so many variables at play to make such absolute predictions. Worse, these doom-filled messages could lead people to think there's no use in even trying. It seems like these messages are more likely to discourage action than encourage it.

3. Publicly sharing these views invites trolls and climate change deniers to flood the comments with contrary opinions, dubious graphs, and wild theories. I wonder how many people genuinely interested in the climate crisis get swayed by these deniers' arguments.

During the peak of the COVID pandemic, similar patterns emerged on social media. Experts presented complex data and personal opinions regarding vaccine efficacy and the risks posed by new virus strains, aiming to inform the public. However, this often resulted in greater confusion, anxiety, and doubt instead of clarity. It seems we're repeating this scenario with climate scientists.

I'm not sure what the best approach is, but perhaps scientists could avoid sharing unreviewed findings or those that haven't been thoroughly debated academically.

•
The role of the Sun in climate change is hotly debated with diverse models.

•
The Earth’s climate likely influenced by the Sun through a variety of physical mechanisms.

•
Balanced multi-proxy solar records created and their climate effect assessed.

•
Factors other than direct TSI forcing account for around 80% of the solar influence on the climate.

•
Important solar-climate mechanisms to be investigated before developing reliable GCMs.

The result also suggests that at least about 80% of the solar influence on the climate may not be induced by TSI forcing alone, but rather by other Sun-climate processes (e.g., by a solar magnetic modulation of cosmic ray and other particle fluxes, and/or others), which must be thoroughly investigated and physically understood before trustworthy GCMs can be created.

Research suggests that the actual social cost of co2 is $185 per metric ton,129,Dylan0110,1696374243.0,172,0.88,16z6ki3,climatechange,False,"

Abstract
The social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) measures the monetized value of the damages to society caused by an incremental metric tonne of CO2 emissions and is a key metric informing climate policy. Used by governments and other decision-makers in benefit–cost analysis for over a decade, SC-CO2 estimates draw on climate science, economics, demography and other disciplines. However, a 2017 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine1 (NASEM) highlighted that current SC-CO2 estimates no longer reflect the latest research. The report provided a series of recommendations for improving the scientific basis, transparency and uncertainty characterization of SC-CO2 estimates. Here we show that improved probabilistic socioeconomic projections, climate models, damage functions, and discounting methods that collectively reflect theoretically consistent valuation of risk, substantially increase estimates of the SC-CO2. Our preferred mean SC-CO2 estimate is $185 per tonne of CO2 ($44–$413 per tCO2: 5%–95% range, 2020 US dollars) at a near-term risk-free discount rate of 2%, a value 3.6 times higher than the US government’s current value of $51 per tCO2. Our estimates incorporate updated scientific understanding throughout all components of SC-CO2 estimation in the new open-source Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) model, in a manner fully responsive to the near-term NASEM recommendations. Our higher SC-CO2 values, compared with estimates currently used in policy evaluation, substantially increase the estimated benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation and thereby increase the expected net benefits of more stringent climate policies.",False,False,False,False

When you divide the world, there is the “West” and the “East” (think BRICCS+).

1. If both the West and East cooperate, they will both incur a decrease in standard of living and quality of life, but benefit from non-extinction.

2. If either the West or East give up fossil fuels, but the other does not then you end up with a slower extinction, but the nations not giving up fossil fuels will likely lead a generally better standard of living / quality of life. 

3. If neither gives up fossil fuels, extinction is imminent and both continue on as they are today. 

The interesting piece comes down to Point 2. With the rise of BRICCS+ I predict that it is far more likely that Point 2 will win out. And I would also predict it will be BRICCS+ that continues and further advances the adoption of fossil fuels. 

This leads me to a logical endpoint I can’t seem to shake: If you firmly believe climate change is an extinction level event, then you must be ready to go to war in the name of climate change at some point. For, if you do not, then you will certainly go extinct.

Antarctic Sea Ice and Ozone Hole,0,Honest_Cynic,1696285743.0,3,0.44,16yan84,climatechange,False,"This report is alarming, and purposely so (click-bait):

[https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/ozone-day-2023-why-the-south-pole-has-set-alarm-bells-ringing-this-year-91787](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/ozone-day-2023-why-the-south-pole-has-set-alarm-bells-ringing-this-year-91787)

We've discussed the lesser sea ice this Antarctic Winter, which reached a lesser max extent that past years, though exceeded the median extent line on the Western side (Peninsula, towards S. America) and a few other places.  So let's review the other concern, the Ozone Hole (OH), which has recently been tied to Climate Change (CC), and in both directions.

First, it is humorous that when OH was smaller in 2019 than years since measurement began in the 1980's, the U.N. was crowing ""Fixed it by eliminating CFC's per Montreal Protocol"".  Those reports are hard to find now since apparently buried and promoting a new story.  The reason being that in following years OH was larger than ever and 2023 may turn out the largest still.  They respun that by claiming models showed upper atmosphere circulations, due to CC (Polar Vortex, PV) cooled the Stratosphere, to form more ice crystals which decrease the ozone.  This only occurs during Antarctic Winter, when almost no sun, so I've never understood the fuss about ""increased uV on ground"", but the concern was that OH would eventually extend to temperate latitudes.  A 2019 link about ""fixed 'er"",  followed by a link with ""new 'xplainin"" (PV), plus blaming the even bigger OH in 2023 on the Tonga volcano:

[https://www.euronews.com/2019/09/16/current-ozone-hole-could-be-one-of-the-smallest-in-30-years-copernicus](https://www.euronews.com/2019/09/16/current-ozone-hole-could-be-one-of-the-smallest-in-30-years-copernicus)

[https://www.space.com/antarctic-ozone-hole-early-hunga-tonga](https://www.space.com/antarctic-ozone-hole-early-hunga-tonga)

This link argues the ""other way"", that OH increase CC.  They quote a scientist speculating that increased uV hitting the ice/ocean will significantly increase the radiant heat input from the sun.  I say ""speculate"" because no link to calculations to support that claim.  Relatively little energy in sunlight is in the uV.  It is more a concern for skin cancer than radiant energy.  There is little sunlight in Antarctic Winter when OH exists.  Hopefully, more to come.  I see too many unsupported CC claims which are never challenged, and predictions which are quickly forgotten (or buried) when they don't come true.

Make it rain,11,jgambs,1696097245.0,18,0.79,16wdkfg,climatechange,False," 

As the oceans heat up, the number and severity of hurricanes will increase. Hurricanes begin as tropical disturbances where a low-pressure area is formed. The low pressure creates an updraft with strong winds, which causes the ocean to evaporate more rapidly, creating a stronger storm. As this cycle repeats over thousands of miles of travel over the oceans, it becomes incredibly powerful, growing exponentially. When the hurricane reaches the shore, it causes tremendous damage to the shore, but it quickly weakens once it is over land instead of water.

If the low-pressure zones form close to shore, they increase in strength as they travel over the ocean, but they do not have enough time to become destructive before making landfall. Because of this, their only effect is to increase rainfall, cool the oceans, and create more clouds, which help reflect the sun’s energy back into space. All of these are good things.

Intense low-pressure zones can form naturally due to baroclinic instability. Horizontal differences in air temperature and pressure create vertical wind shear. The wind shear creates waves in the atmosphere, and if the interference pattern of the waves is constructive, it causes the magnitude to increase.

Instead of waiting for baroclinic instability to occur naturally, we could try to create them. Water evaporation and condensation absorb and release tremendous amounts of energy (2,260 kJ/kg), always occurring. We can accelerate the rate of water evaporation by spraying it as a droplet. The smaller the droplet, the greater the surface area to volume ratio becomes. Additionally, as the droplet settles, air flows over it, increasing the evaporation rate further.

A one-horsepower water pump (like this [one ](https://www.grainger.com/product/Submersible-Deep-Well-Pump-1LZR8)) can move 12 gallons per minute 100 feet at a pressure differential of 50 PSI. Assuming only half of the 12 gallons sprayed into the air evaporate (22.7 kg), it would still absorb 50 MJ of energy per minute. The energy inputted into the pump is only 44 kJ per minute22. By using evaporative cooling at 50% efficiency, it still magnifies the work done by the pump by over 100,000 %. This magnifies a 1,000 hp engine to a 1,000,000 hp engine.

This will cause the temperature of the surface of the ocean to decrease, humid air is less dense than dry air, causing the more humid air to form a low-pressure zone. As the humid air travels upwards, it cools and the water vapor begins to condense, causing the air to become hotter and more humid than the surrounding air. This will strengthen the low-pressure zone, and create a seed that can form a tropical depression.

Once the tropical depression forms, it will strengthen, further magnifying the work done by the pump, as it travels over the ocean. Because of this, we would need to ensure that the Tropic depression only travels a relatively short distance so they don’t become dangerous. Many coastal regions are arid and would greatly benefit from multiple tropical depressions throughout the year.

In addition to using this for generating rain, it could also be used to try to fight hurricanes. Hurricanes rely on warm water on the surface of the ocean to gain strength. If we were able to create tropical depressions, we could use them to fight hurricanes like we use controlled burns to fight forest fires.

""All of this makes the Bonaventure gannets ideal sentinels for the health of the marine ecosystem in the gulf. They form the world's second largest gannet colony and are easier to reach than the largest, on Scotland's remote Bass Island.
Quebec and global scientists say climate change is surely reshaping the lives of the northern gannets. Warmer sea temperatures drive their prey to cooler depths, distant waters or both.
But the full impact of climate change is not yet established and overfishing may be an even greater danger.
In tandem, the threats from fishing and warming force the gannets to go farther afield in search of food for their island chicks and themselves. The distance the birds fly on a single fishing trip has more than doubled in recent years to an average of 500 kilometres (300 miles), leaving one mate and the chick waiting several days or longer to be fed by the hunter, says Guillemette.
If the mate on the nest gets too weak from hunger, it may fly off for food, too, leaving the young one to starve or to wander from the nest and risk being killed by an adult. Like many seabirds, adult gannets may kill any intruders to their nesting areas.
Researchers have been able to draw a strong correlation between the supply of mackerel in the gulf and the number of chicks produced. In 2012, when there were almost no mackerel, only 4 per cent of the nests produced a chick, Guillemette said, a record low attributed to unusually warm waters that year.""",True,False,False,False

"As someone with money, but no time, how can I make the most meaningful impact on forest conservation?",10,ChimericGames,1695999901.0,32,0.86,16ve2yk,climatechange,False,"TL;DR: I am someone with money but no free time who wants to get involved in forest conservation. Please help me navigate which charities I can trust and how to make the biggest impact mitigating or repairing the effects of climate change.

Hi, Reddit. For a little background, I created a video game startup and against all odds it did quite well in early access. I do most of the work myself, and it's not finished yet, so the job is very demanding. Between working on the game, my toddler, and other obligations, I have very little free time, but I do have savings and investments. As a very eco-conscious person, I want to do something meaningful, but I'm facing paralysis on what actions to take.

I've tried to stay informed. I follow podcasts, Twitter accounts, and read books about climate change and conservation (recently I read ""Evergreen: Saving big forests to save the planet"" by John W. Reid and Thomas E. Lovejoy), but what I'm finding is that almost all of the advice out there on how to get involved is targeted at people who have time and no resources, or explains how to reduce your personal impact, or is focused on expressing that the threat is indeed very dire (of this I am aware). Making calls to government or getting involved locally isn't an option for me, and I have incredibly little faith that it would be meaningful if I did. I want to maximize my impact. But whenever I discuss charities with my family and friends, what is emphasized is that I ought to be incredibly careful which charities can be trusted, who will use the funds well, and to do my own research. I'm trying, but I could use your help.

I can't be sure I'll stay profitable at all, but my long term plan is to transition my games to some model that donates a % of sales to one or more charities, while also trying to boost awareness and maybe get involved with other game developers who are willing to do the same. If you know someone who might be interested to hear this, maybe put me in touch? In the mean time, I can just do donations.

I also see people suggesting that we should invest in green tech, but I'm super uncomfortable putting my money in the hands of some tech company who may or may not be on the right track, and whose word I have to trust at face value. I know that leaving land untouched and protected is one of the best things we can hope to do, so forest conservation charity makes sense to me and feels aligned with my values. But which ones are truly scientifically informed and altruistic? I know what's coming; I don't want to give up hard earned money only to find the forest I tried to protect is now a dust bowl in a few hundred years, or that someone else might have managed the money more responsibly.

Any direction, contacts, or help the community can provide is deeply appreciated. Thank you.

I've read numerous articles about how planting trees is great... but it'll take up to 100 years for them to mature before they start fully absorbing the CO2 that these companies market.

Here's that quote:

""A typical tree can absorb around 21 kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, however this figure is only achieved when the tree is fully grown - saplings will absorb significantly less than this. Over a lifetime of 100 years, one tree could absorb around a tonne of CO2. While this seems like a significant amount, humans are creating about [40 billions tonnes of CO2](https://www.viessmann.co.uk/company/blog/the-carbon-footprint-of-nearly-everything) each year, meaning that we’d need to plant 40 billion trees annually to offset the emissions created. Even if this were possible, land space would be significantly reduced. "" - [Link to Article](https://www.viessmann.co.uk/en/heating-advice/boilers/how-much-co2-does-tree-absorb.html)

Considering the climate crisis is now and not in 100 years, should companies find an alternative method of offsetting/removing their emissions if they can't make them sustainable?

The planet currently using approximately 100M barrels of oil, every day. Just take a look at how insane that is from a layman’s perspective:

**🛢 Daily Depth Over Texas**:
Spreading 100 million barrels of oil over Texas would create a layer about 22.826 micrometers (µm) thick, which is approximately 0.0009 inches. Over a football field: 9,750 ft in depth

**🛢 Annual Depth Over Texas**:
Spreading this amount over Texas every day for a year would result in a layer roughly 8.33 mm thick, or about 0.328 inches by year's end. Over a football field: 674 miles

**🌫 CO₂ Comparison to Pre-Industrial Levels**:
Burning 100 million barrels of oil daily for a year releases approximately 15.7 billion metric tons of CO₂. When compared to the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere before the Industrial Revolution, this annual addition is roughly 10.88% of the original pre-industrial amount.

I believe in anthropogenic global warming, just to get that out of the way. The question is how we can know that this is primarily due to CO2 release and not waste heat? The effect each of these would have on global warming is quite complex, and I am not sure if anybody has been able to quantify the waste heat effect on the global temperature. So how can we know that this is almost negligible compared to the greenhouse effect, because that seems to be the assumption?

Since waste heat and CO2 are correlated, they also both correlate strongly with the global temperature. So it is not easy to separate the two merely by considering empirical data. But I have thought about a couple of things that speak in favor of the waste heat effect being more dominant compared to CO2 than we perhaps tend to think.

* The warming asymmetry that has been identified suggests that night temperatures and annual minimum temperatures increase more than day and annual maximum, respectively. I think this is better explained by increased heating than CO2.
* Global temperatures during WWII were significantly higher than the years before and after. It seems more than a coincidence. We know that was a time with a lot of combustion by ramped up production and military activity. Releasing CO2 in the atmosphere too of course, but that would not explain the cooling after WWII, so again waste heat seems a better explanation. 

I realize that I may be making some wrong assumptions along the way, and that there might be other evidence that is better explained by CO2 than waste heat. So if you know anything about this, please enlighten me.",True,False,False,False

ill start with a few:  

Here are some innovative solutions cited from the past 6 years that could help address the sustainability problems:

Bar-On et al. (2018) study on declining mammal biomass:

- Cultured meat production techniques: Novel cell culture and tissue engineering methods are being developed to produce meat without raising and slaughtering livestock, helping mitigate land use impacts. (Post, 2012)

- Insect farming for animal feed: Emerging technologies enable sustainable breeding of insects like black soldier flies that can provide high-quality feed supplement for livestock, reducing agricultural land needs. (Veldkamp et al., 2012)


Newbold et al. (2020) study on future food production impacts:  

- Precision fermentation of proteins: Companies are using precision fermentation to produce protein-rich foods like cultured dairy without the land use footprint of livestock. (Perfect Day, 2016) 

- Indoor vertical farming: Controlled environment agriculture using minimal land and resources indoors is being scaled up for urban locations near populations. (AeroFarms, 2017)


Jambeck et al. (2015) study on ocean plastic pollution:

- Plastic waste pyrolysis: Thermal and chemical recycling technologies can convert mixed plastic waste into fuels and waxes, preventing plastic leakage. (Agilyx, 2016)

- Biodegradable plastic alternatives: Many startups are developing sustainable bioplastics derived from agricultural residues or microbes that can degrade in ocean environments. (Bio circulating, 2018)

----------

Here are 5 innovations/discoveries from the past 3 years that are helping to address the issue of global warming:

1. Direct air capture technology - In 2021, Climeworks opened the world's largest direct air capture plant in Iceland that captures CO2 directly from the air. This provides a way to actively remove CO2 already in the atmosphere. (Climeworks, 2021)

2. Lower-cost solar panels - Significant improvements in solar panel efficiency and manufacturing have driven costs down around 89% in the last decade. This is helping solar become one of the cheapest sources of new electricity. (IRENA, 2021) 

3. Low-carbon building materials - Companies are developing innovative building materials like low-carbon concrete and mass timber that can significantly reduce embodied carbon in construction. (Materials startup Anthropic raises $55M, 2021)

4. Green hydrogen production - Technologies for producing hydrogen via renewable energy instead of fossil fuels are advancing. This could enable decarbonization of hard-to-electrify sectors like shipping and heavy industry. (Sandia engineers make big renewable hydrogen leap, 2021)

As is known, most of the southern hemisphere has been suffering with the effects of a heat dome lately. In my city by the end of this winter we were already reaching temps as high as 25-30ºC. **Yes, in WINTER.** Our winters are never very cold but here we'd usually have like 10-15 ºC at this time of the year and temperatures above 30ºC are rare even in summer. Then spring started and this week we are reaching 34-38ºC. This is just the beginning of spring!

My mind doesn't work very well in the heat so uh, right now it feels like I might never see a cold weather again and it's horrifying. Probably overreacting because of heat stress, but still. Perhaps I was not keeping up with the news about climate change, but I thought it would take a few more years before we would see something like this.

Columbia University 

https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/07/30/co2-drives-global-warming/#:~:text=CO2%20makes%20up%20only%20about,to%20escape%20without%20being%20absorbed.
""CO2 makes up only about 0.04% of the atmosphere, and water vapor can vary from 0 to 4%. But while water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas in our atmosphere, it has “windows” that allow some of the infrared energy to escape without being absorbed. In addition, water vapor is concentrated lower in the atmosphere, whereas CO2 mixes well all the way to about 50 kilometers up. The higher the greenhouse gas, the more effective it is at trapping heat from the Earth’s surface.

Both water vapor and CO2 are responsible for global warming, and once we increase the CO2 in the atmosphere, the oceans warm up, which inevitably triggers an increase in water vapor. But while we have no way to control water vapor, we can control CO2. And because we are increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by continuing to burn fossil fuels, even in relatively small amounts compared to the entire mass of the atmosphere, we are disturbing the entire heat balance of the planet.""

World Meteorological Org -https://public.wmo.int/en/resources/bulletin/observing-water-vapour

""Some atmospheric gases, such as water vapour and CO2, absorb and re-emit infrared energy from the atmosphere down to the Earth’s surface. This process, the greenhouse effect, leads to a mean surface temperature that is 33 °C greater than it would be in its absence. If it were not for the greenhouse gas effect, Earth’s average temperature would be a chilly -18 °C. However, it is the non-condensable or long-lived greenhouse gases – mainly CO2, but also methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and halocarbons (CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs) – that act as the drivers of the greenhouse effect. Water vapour and clouds act as fast feedbacks – that is to say that water vapour responds rapidly to changes in temperature, through evaporation, condensation and precipitation.

This strong water vapour feedback means that for a scenario considering a doubling of the CO2 concentration from pre-industrial conditions, water vapour and clouds globally lead to an increase in thermal energy that is about three times that of the long-lived greenhouse gases. Therefore, measured in the ability to trap the heat emanating from the Earth’s surface, water vapour and clouds are the largest contributors to warming. The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is a direct response to the amount of CO2 and the other long-lived greenhouse gases, increasing as they do.

It is impossible for us to control directly the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere since water is found everywhere on our planet – it covers 71% of Earth’s surface. To limit the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere and control Earth’s temperature, we must limit the greenhouse gases that we can, in practice, do something about: CO2 and the other long-lived greenhouse gases.""

Artificial Superintelligence and the Climate Crisis,4,ReadSeparate,1695497834.0,93,0.56,16qd76o,climatechange,False,"Hello, I wanted to get some people's opinions on this issue. As most/all of you know, artificial intelligence as a field has been developing rapidly. Alongside that, climate change is likely to cause extremely dire problems for human civilization if we don't make major changes in energy, behaviors, and resource usage. 

Climate change used to worry me more than anything in the world aside from nuclear apocalypse. Now, it's barely on my mind. 

Why? Because of AI. AI has advanced at a rapid pace, and 90% of AI experts believe that we will achieve human level AI by 2075: https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/

This is a relatively conservative estimate, and the timelines seem to be moving closer and closer. 

In fact, OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT and one of the world's leading organizations in AI, believes that Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), which is AI which **exceeds** human level intelligence, might arrive **this decade**: https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment#fn-A

There's no telling how high the ceiling is on intelligence, though we know for at least some domains it's possible to be superior to human minds in both speed and abilities (think how the best chess player in the world is a computer, or the fastest calculator in the world is a computer). It may be the case that one day, the smartest being on Earth will be millions of times smarter than the human race combined - a God in a box so to speak.

If we are able to build minds that exceed our own before the century is over, then surely they will have the ability to solve the climate crisis.

As we know, it's physically possible to solve climate change, after all, we caused it in the first place with our physical and chemical actions.

This has pretty much completely replaced my fear of climate change with a new fear of AI. 

If we build superhuman AI before the climate change crisis hits its peak, which seems likely at this point, then one of two things will happen:

1. If the AI is aligned with human interests, it will solve this issue, along with many/all others, for us with new technologies
2. If the AI is not aligned with human interests, we have a way bigger problem on our hands and it can just kill us all anyway 

What do you all think of this? I think it's very reasonable and placed in pretty grounded trends and science, however, it's completely possible that, for some reason, it takes us way longer than expected to build ASI, and thus the climate apocalypse gets to us first. That seems very unlikely, but it seems like the only option in which we get screwed by climate change. The probability of superhuman intelligence NOT being able to solve climate change seems so low that it's almost not even worth considering.

Does anyone have any arguments against this? I haven't heard/thought of any that I haven't accounted for here (mainly being what if we're too late in building ASI)",True,False,False,False

I understand that climate change started when Earth reached a point where it can’t efficiently recycle the additional CO2 produced by people and our lifestyle.

Ok, so if we want to fix it, how much additional CO2 can a human emit every year so earth can be happy?

Climate change officially started in the beginning of the 1800, ok, that is good, so before that there was no noticeable climate change, which means that year was the turning point.

How many people lived back in 1800? 1 billion people, good, what was the average co2 footprint for each? Not many details are available, but the estimate is .05 tons per year.

Ok, so back in year 1800 the entire population co2 footprint was 50 million tons. so, everything after 50 million tons is hey, you are on your own.

Ok, but Earth triggered tons of temporary processes that have evolved over billions of years to help with the issue, including the ocean absorption of CO2, which is all helping us a lot, but these temporary processes will have some limits eventually.

If I’ve missed some important models that predict this existential crisis then please inform me - are there any credible scenarios that predict human extinction in the next hundred years?

Edit: since this has got quite a few responses, it seems that extinction is used by many people to mean the same as “human society collapsing”, or just really really bad for humans, and that I might be using the word too literally. For those people arguing that CC has potential to be really really bad for us - I agree with you 100%. Also, my apologies if I was a bit curt in some responses, like “that’s not extinction”, or something like that. Wasn’t trying to be rude. For me, I’ve only ever used that word literally, and that may account for some of the misunderstandings I’ve had on this sub.

There are also some people who do mean it in the literal sense. It seems that these are opinions/conclusions that they’ve come to themselves rather than getting it from a study (which is fine, not attacking that at all). I just happen to disagree. I also don’t have a list of studies conclusively showing that we will not go extinct.

There was a graph indicating 'The Earth has been getting progressively colder over the last 50 million years' showing the relative temperature fluctuations. There is a zoom in of the current interglacial period.

Images: [https://imgur.com/a/ZAitJaw](https://imgur.com/a/ZAitJaw)

Can someone who understands the science explain to me, within the context of the current climate change crisis, how our relative global temperature increase deviates from past glacial events?

For example, climate scientists say that a 1.5-3° average temp increase is catastrophic to global systems. But on this graph, it shows over the past 500,000 years fluctuations of +6°C to -3°C as normal. Our current period is totally in line with the last 4 periods.

Further, it shows global temperatures cooling (Global temperature variations over the past  50 million years) from a relative temperature  that was 14°C higher than current temperatures!

So how does the science work in all of this? Is this just a human crisis and not a planetary crisis, meaning it's catastrophic to humans if the temperature rises 3°? Like if the sea levels rise 200' its catastrophic to us but pretty normal for the planet?

As a lay person I don't understand.

UPDATE

As others have pointed out, it's the current short term rate of temperature increase that is catastrophic to humans, not that the earth can't support a temperature increase.

Also, whale hunting reducing the amount of whale-falls caused a small but measurable impact on the amount of carbon transported to the ocean floor via the biological pump.

Hey fellow Redditors,

I wanted to start a discussion about the pressing issue of climate change and its effects on coastal cities around the world. With rising sea levels and extreme weather events becoming more frequent, it’s crucial that we talk about this and brainstorm potential solutions.

Here are a few questions to kick things off:

	1.	How has climate change already affected your local coastal area?
	2.	What initiatives or policies are being implemented in your region to address these challenges?
	3.	What can individuals do to mitigate the impact of climate change on coastal cities?
	4.	Are there any innovative technologies or projects you’ve come across that offer hope for the future?

Let’s use this thread to share information, experiences, and ideas on how we can collectively tackle this global issue. Remember to be respectful and open-minded in your discussions.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 🌍🌊",True,False,False,False

RANT 

Asking for other petrol heads in the same position..
My feed is either filled with posts about all the climate change related flooding that is happening or extreme weather events caused this week. Or the coral reefs in the keys that have bleached this summer.

I love riding my bike but since getting my driving license and injuring my back rarely do so for commuting purposes. 
I rarely ever use the shitty public transport to travel anywhere especially for surf trips. 

I also see posts from the car community hating on EVs. Yes its funny and yes I agree they are not as fun to drive as a petrol car. They have no personality and are very limited in terms of modifications. They also in my opinion are not really an effective solution to climate change, instead just a somewhat temporary solution to a more deep rooted problem. 

I also see the comments section of people outright denying climate change within the car/ general community, which is slightly concerning. I feel like most people have an incredibly limited idea of what is actually happening. 

 I can't really support either side but feel somewhat guilty not doing my part for climate change. That being said all the cars I have driven are so much more economical compared to their American counterparts. And my dad is a great mechanic who has kept our cars going. 

But yeah it feels like a rant. I either enjoy the freedoms of my 20s and feel guilty that the planet is burning or don't travel and feel shitty that I'm wasting my youth.
I'd vote for the green party but feel like they are too extreme to secure a place, and all the other parties are happy to sit around and do fuck all. 
 
Maybe I'm waiting for the glimmer of hope that synthetic petroleum can keep car enthusiasts going whilst most people switch to electric.

Misinformation by climate skeptics that keeps being posted over and over. This post presents a counter argument to the claims,238,Tpaine63,1694737997.0,248,0.84,16iytcz,climatechange,False,"  

[This](https://co2coalition.org/news/two-princeton-mit-scientists-say-epa-climate-regulations-based-on-a-hoax/) article has been posted 5 times very recently which contains a lot of mis-information. The mis-information has been pointed out but the article continues to appear as if there is no problem. This post is a total summary of the problems with this article.

Not a part of the article but it is often stated these are two eminent scientist. But that is argument by authority since it’s the facts, not the credentials of the author that matter. The definition of eminent is “respected within a particular sphere or profession.”. Neither are respected by their peers within the field of climate science.

The comment on the first graph states “Climate models like the ones that the EPA is using have been consistently wrong for decades in predicting actual outcomes, Mr. Happer told The Epoch Times. The graph shows the deviation between the actual temperatures and the measured temperatures over 40,000 feet above the surface of the planet. Although the article is dated this year, the data is fairly dated. [Here](https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2023/03/some-new-cmip6-msu-comparisons/#ITEM-24767-0) is a more recent examination with updated data. And [here](https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2021/01/update-day-2021/) is an article showing how surface models have projected compared to actual measurements updated to 2021. Since the surface of the planet is where most of life lives, that is what would seem important to humans.

The next graph shows CO2 levels with global temperature levels for the life of the planet. The intent is to show that CO2 levels do not correlate with temperatures. However the sun’s radiation has increased 30% over the life of the planet. So the temperature of the earth should be adjusted to account for the lower radiation from the sun billions of years ago. The global temperatures certainly do not follow the sun’s radiation over billions of years. [Here](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Temperature-change-over-the-past-400-000-years-correlate-closely-with-variations-in_fig1_308983884) is a graph of CO2 vs global temperatures over the past 200k years when the sun’s radiation has changed very little and it shows a close correlation. 

The next graph that shows synthetic fertilizers does nothing to show the climate models are wrong.

The next graph that shows population increase and also does nothing to show the climate models are wrong.

The next graph that shows the additional CO2 effect does not increase in proportion to the amount of CO2 added. But this is well known by scientists and is included in the models so it does nothing to show the climate models are wrong.

The next graph that shows an increasing ratio of daily record high-to-low temperatures to indicate rising global temperatures. Then he makes the comment 

*“This chart does not actually show ‘daily temperatures,’” they state. “Instead it show a ‘ratio’ of daily record highs to lows – a number that appears designed to create the impression that temperatures are steadily rising.”*

He then gives no reason it does not show rising temperature and I don’t think any scientist doesn’t accept that global temperatures are rising. But more to the point he uses the next graph of “heat Wave Index” to try and show temperatures were higher in the 1930s than they are today. Somewhat unbelievably that chart also doesn’t show temperatures which is exactly what he criticizes the EPA of being deceitful about. I have never seen any graph that shows global or US temperatures in the 1930s to be higher than today. And it does nothing to show the climate models are wrong.

He then goes on a little talk about consensus of scientists doesn’t determine science and ends up with this statement:

*“Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world,” Dr. Crichton said. “In science, consensus is irrelevant. What are relevant are reproducible results.”* 

But he fails to present any scientific research that can produce any reproducible results contradicts what climate scientist are saying about climate change. 

Then this statement:

*“The initial predictions of climate disasters had New York flooded by now, no ice left at the North Pole, England would be like Siberia by now,”* 

But never gives who or where this prediction was made.

He then goes into some quotes about how anyone who dissents is not invited to speak at meetings. Pretty much like flat earthers are also not invited to speak at meetings. Neither of which has anything to do with climate science.

And then more whining about thousands of climate scientist all over the world in every country are deceiving the public for some reason. Also has nothing to do with climate science.

If one entered our solar system, it would not even have to get near earth to cause monumental climate change; just the gravitational pull it had on Jupiter would be enough to pull earth's trajectory out of the habital zone from a near circular orbit to an eliptical orbit, taking earth as close to the sun as Venus and as far out as Mars. two opposite extremes of hot and cold. Although theoretically we would still remain in the habital zone of the earth, climate change would go haywire in an instant. As we know, over the last few years, the world's media has been reporting the surge in earthquakes, wildfires, and volcanic eruptions as isolated events rather than reporting them as connected.

I'm very disturbed by the number of people who support climate engineering,368,bananas1224,1694470873.0,360,0.88,16g9ehy,climatechange,False,"It's really not a good idea. 

I'm going to list a few points that form the basis of my opinion that it's really not a good idea.

1. Carbon dioxide emissions aren't just warming the planet. They are also making the ocean more acidic. Oceans uptake CO2. This lowers the pH of the ocean in a process called ocean acidification. If we keep emitting CO2, even with a perfect geoengineering scheme that offsets CO2 warming perfectly (unlikely), the oceans will still become more acidic. This is a global threat to ocean life. We need to stop emitting CO2 for that reason alone. 

2. The Earth is warming nonuniformly. The Arctic is warming 2-3x faster than the rest of the planet, termed Arctic amplification. Any geoengineering scheme must offset not only the global mean rise in temperature but also the pattern of warming. Some studies suggest that injecting aerosol in the  stratosphere may not offset Arctic amplification. This means that even if the global mean temperature is held fixed, the Arctic temperature may continue to rise. This could still lead to sea level rise. 

3. Unintended consequences. As a climate scientist, I can tell you this: we don't understand everything about climate change. Not even close, and I'm not trying to make us look bad. It's just a fact most people outside of academia don't realize. An example is climate sensitivity. A basic question, ""how much does the temperature rise when doubling CO2?"" varies by between 2 and 8 K in models participating CMIP6. This enormous spread has gotten bigger despite our best efforts to constrain climate models. Along these lines, it's worth noting that you can change extremely esoteric parameters in climate model, like convective entrainment rate, and change the climate sensitivity tremendously. And we don't know why. Now, knowing this, do you really feel comfortable injecting Aerosol into the stratosphere when the only source of knowledge we have on the impacts this would have come from models? Models that can't agree on climate sensitivity for reasons we don't understand, despite decades of research? Let me be clear: we know CO2 is warming the planet and we know why. But there are tons of things we don't understand. Another example is the hydrological cycle. We don't have a full grasp of how/why precipitation will change from raising CO2. There are papers about it constantly. So, we certainly don't know what would happen to the hydrological cycle if we add Aerosol to the stratosphere. The fact is this: the consequence of injecting Aerosol in the stratosphere has a non negligible chance of making things worse. I don't have enough trust in climate models to make decisions about geoengineering based on their predictions, and this is coming from someone who works at lab developing climate models.

4. Frankly, the studies on climate engineering are not great and still in their infancy. Many studies on injecting Aerosol in the stratosphere model it stupendously crudely: they simply reduce the solar constant in a climate model by an amount that they assume Aerosols would dim sunlight. The reality is, injecting Aerosol in the stratosphere wouldn't be as simple as reducing the solar constant by a uniform amount globally. Aerosol can move. Aersol can interact with longwave radiation as well as shortwave. People of course know this, but modeling the physics precisely is a challenge that is still being incorporated into studies.

5. While I'm not an expert outside of the science side of things, I can't help but think about the international effort required to accomplish climate engineering. It would require international cooperation, tremendous technological advances, and money. A question: is it really easier to stop climate change by using engineering rather than using more sustainable infrastructure? To me, both climate engineering and developing sustainable infrastructure face the same difficult hurdles mentioned earlier: international cooperation, technological advances, money. So to me, it's not clear why climate engineering would be an easier way to solve the problem. Perhaps some people on this thread think it's necessary to work on both climate engineering and reducing CO2. Another question: would the resources spent on climate engineering be better spent on developing sustainable infrastructure? (I think you know my opinion on this).

Final thoughts: 
1. I want to mention something also many people on this thread probably don't realize. Most climate scientists oppose implementation of climate engineering. I work at a lab that employs _many_ climate scientists. Nobody here thinks it's a good idea. Even people studying climate engineering at my lab don't support it's use. 
2. This is far from an exhaustive list of drawbacks. 
3. I focused on Aerosol injection in the stratosphere, but other geoengineering schemes, such as cloud brightening, have been proposed. These face similar problems. 
4. I support further study of geoengineering. A model Intercomparison Project for it exists and is called GeoMIP. Note even GeoMIP acknowledges the potential for dangerous consequences associated with geoengineering. See: http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/geomip/

Edit: also wanted to mention that the only intervention I do support direct air capture. This is because zero emissions doesn't reverse global warming. We need direct air capture to cool the planet. See: https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/blog_held/23-cumulative-emissions/

Edit 2: It seems from the comments I have a bit to learn about DAC and the different methods of drawing down CO2. I'm not informed on the drawbacks DAC vs other methods. In complete honesty, I wrote DAC but was incorrectly using it to express my opinions about CO2 drawdown in general. All I know is this: we need negative CO2 emissions to reverse global warming. Temperatures _stabilize_ with zero emissions. Maybe DAC isn't the best way to accomplish negative emissions, but we do need negative emissions to reverse warming.",True,False,False,False

\-We are going to more from New Zealand to WA to live. My wife wants to live permanently in WA. I want to settle in NZ. There are many reasons why I want to be in NZ and among them is my belief that most of NZ (not all) will fare better than likely anywhere in WA in terms of future habitation. For the most part right now this is just my belief. I have not found documentation which makes it plain that this belief is correct.

\-We both agree that we would like to purchase land affordable to us and to work towards greater personal sufficiency for our family. Thinking particularly fruit and nut trees, growing vegetables, chickens, sheep etc. Climate change, resource depletion etc very much in consideration with this.

\-Looking at average rainfall and tempretures, the coastal southern region of WA appears to fare much better than other parts of the state (lower tempretures, higher rainfall). I understand that broadly though, WA is expecting to become dryer and hotter, and it already seems hot and dry to me..

\-NZ has had it’s share of weather events in recent years, particularly with several disastourous rain events in 2023, but my belief is that even in spite of this NZ broadly seems to be the better place to be for ongoing habitation – Better soil and climate for growing things. Many parts of the country appear better positioned than other places for the changing times. I acknowledge though that my main draw to NZ is an emotional one.

If you could choose to live in WA or NZ which would you choose, or is their no  difference???

The town is guaranteed to flood again (probably the next La Niña) - the months of work, travel and vast quantities of materials going into this one house must have quite the Carbon Footprint.. and this will be ruined and destroyed at the next flood. This cycle must be playing itself out all over the globe, or if it’s not the same town being rebuilt it’s the one next door.

Climate change is not an existential threat. The climate of the earth is in perpetual flux. Perhaps humans are affecting it, perhaps not. But over time, technology makes our world a better place to live. The changes being forced on us by government (EVs, solar power, wind power, etc.) are creating unnatural market dislocations, and reducing, not improving people's standard of living. In a free market, eventually the best technologies will win. If you want to drive an EV, have at it, but there are better solutions on the horizon. Hydrogen power, given time and a fair shot in a free market would win out over battery technology. Fill up your car as fast as filling up with gasoline, clean emissions (H2O), eliminating the range and fire hazard issue with batteries, and with no mining or battery disposal concerns.

If we want to run on electricity, shouldn't we address the issue at the source? Nuclear is clearly the cleanest reliable source of electricity. Why are we not investing in new nuclear technology?

Airplanes will never, ever, be battery powered, nor will the massive mining equipment or slave labor that digs up the metals needed to make them.

Just spitballing...,0,TMax01,1694129890.0,22,0.4,16cueie,climatechange,False,"I got yet another news alert about a storm ""expected to develop into a Category 5 hurricane"" and that got me thinking.

Many people think that a lot of the difficulty of dealing with climate change (in terms of mitigating and preventing it, rather than merely reacting to weather events) involves communication, both of the science and of the gravity of the real-world results and urgent need for seemingly outrageous modification of our collective behavior. I think an important step in this direction would be to eradicate the familiar nomenclature of storm severity and replace it with something more meaningful in real-world terms, something more useful in both reacting to weather events and comprehending the scale and scope of the underlying problem of AGW.

The conventional ""category"" system (the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind scale) was developed by meteorologists and is based on a storm's maximums sustained wind speed. While this is a useful measure of potential damage to residential infrastructure, it is both banal and inaccurate, in real terms. It is so dated it borders on archaic, and not nearly precise enough to mean anything more than that a hurricane will be ""really big"" in practical terms. It doesn't take into account that so-called ""hundred year storms"" are now occuring more than once a decade. And the Fujita Tornado Damage scale has essentially the same problem. Both seemed like good ideas in times past, focusing as they do on the potential impact on individual houses, but neither takes into account the even more important issues of how widespread the damage will be, and how much ancillary catastrophe (from flooding, damage to infrastructure rather than individual buildings, and similar issues) results from a truly huge storm. Both ""top out"" at a conventional level of ""the worst that (used to be) normally possible and anything even worse than that"".

So here's my suggestion. I believe we (meaning they, the people who deal with such things professionally, particularly NOAA and perhaps the IPCC) should develop a new approach to reporting the potential severity and impact of hurricanes, typhoons, tornados, etc. It should work like this: develop a formula (the details are largely irrelevant, so long as it is the same formula for all events of a given type) that takes into account direct effects, such as wind damage and rainfall, as well as resulting devastation (damage to infrastructure, including houses, utilities, industry, and transportation, and lasting impact on the environment) and also *real effect* (death, injury, and dislocation of human beings). Rank the most severe storms in our scientific record using this formula (this 'ranking' approach is why the details of the formula are irrelevant) and identify the worst ten, or worst hundred, such weather events. Then, when a new weather event is threatening to cause drastic affects on people's lives, identify the storm publicly as ""level 10"" (for example: equivalent to the tenth worst event of that type) or ""level 1"" (equal to the worst such storm), including, when applicable, by name. To hear that there is a ""Category 5 hurricane approaching"" is simply abstract information, causing grave distress to the people who are most worried but not most concerned, and being ignored as just another news alert by everyone else. But to hear that there is ""a level 1 hurricane, comparable to Katrina"", and be told that this isn't just ""wind speed"", but how many thousands of people could well be killed, how many tens of thousands may become homeless, how many billions of dollars it could take to even begin to recover, and have real scientific validity (because while it may be based on projections, these will be measurable projections comparable to more than mere meteorology), might be more than worth the effort. Not just in terms of how people will react to that specific event, but how much they recognize that ***things are not going to start getting better, every year will be worse (on average) than the last, and there is no end in sight until we start making serious efforts to not just limit how much carbon we are sending into the atmosphere with fossil fuels but removing the excess we've already ""desequestered""***. 

I think that ""level 1"" will not be enough, of course, since things will indeed keep getting worse, with ""hundred year storms"" happening more and more frequently, and all storms being just a bit more powerful than they would have been without AGW. We don't want this new ""level"" scale to suffer the same problem that the ""category"" one did, topping out at a ""this or higher"" metric. We should have a 1+ level to indicate a valid expert concensus (from meteorologists, climatologists and other biospheric researchers, and emergency management professionals) that the coming storm may well be worse than any we have seen before. And on top of that, a 1++ level, to identify that this coming catastrophe could be up to *twice* as bad as the worst we've had to deal with, and even a 1+++ to mean that it is expected to be up to three times as bad.

Obviously, the precision of the immediate identification and the reliance on projected damage will be less than what we can produce with the current scales, but as I have already mentioned, the current scales aren't very precise in human terms to begin with. A ""Category 5"" that only hits relatively uninhabited regions is still a ""Category 5"", and only takes wind speed into account to begin with. We need something more practical, and the varience that multiple groups of experts, or individual experts, might have about any particular event will not result in less concern and discussion but more, and provide valuable information that people can intelligently use to learn who knows the most and has the best ability to project these things on an ongoing basis. What is more, the ""scale"" will automatically adjust *without losing efficacy* as it will always be constantly re-assessed against the ten (or hundred) worst storms that have already occured, rather than just an abstract (and not nearly as certain as we pretend) and unchanging equivalency between wind speed and damage to houses and telephone poles.

Obviously, this would require tremendously more work and study than simply maintaining the (insufficient) status quo. And that right there is a prime reason for doing it. We need to do better and we need to do more, all of us, both the experts and the relatively passive audience hearing the proclamations of those experts alike.

Standard atmosphere as far back as I can remember is 15°c at mean sea level at 1013.25hpa. (from my air force training)

Maybe I'm way off here but an avarage increase of 1.5°c is 10% up on 15°c, and the level of evaporation, higher saturation points, more water vapour suspended for same high relative humidity.. it's a recipe for electrical storms, heavy downpours, hurricanes etc. 

So why does the UN and everyone else keep saying we're 1.5° above pre-industrial temps? Not that it's incorrect, but it just sounds like such a small number, like they're understating the seriousness of it and what it means in real terms. 

If they said that the lower atmospheres capacity to hold water vapour has increased by X%, that the frequency and amount of rainfall will increase by X% would it not be more accurate? Would it encourage people to be more environmentally aware when purchasing/consuming.

As these climate events happen the increased moisture in the atmosphere will trap even more heat leading to even more evaporation leading to heavier more sustained rainfall.

But without cuts from these nations, any other CO2 cuts will have marginal benefits to the planet. So are we screwed? Aka are we bound to experience serious climate related events no matter what we do?

And if serious warming will occur, wouldn’t it be better to spend our money preparing for those climate events by shoring up our infrastructure rather than tackling a problem that’s inevitable?

Some background: grew up disliking climate change and not being a believer.

Since, I am not of the beliefs I was when growing up. Most of my recent adulthood has been me just being ignorant with no opinion or thoughts on the matter.

Yesterday, I watched a video that i felt broke it down and explained things well and in depth.  Something I feel I haven’t heard from anyone else. Safe to say, I fully believe in it and that it is a problem.

My question now is, how do scientist actually know that this rapid change we’ve seen in the last 200 ish years will have worse or very bad affects?

If there has never been a rapid climate change in Earth’s history such as we have seen recently, how do they know what will happen?

Is climate change driving the war in Ukraine?,0,Tliish,1693588416.0,20,0.37,167d0v0,climatechange,False," 

Siberia is melting. Could that be what is driving Russia's war on Ukraine?

Climate change is effecting Russia more strongly than other countries because more of Russia is in the permafrost zone. Reports going back to 2005 have discussed the melt, and how it has been effecting the infrastructure across millions of square miles as the ground becomes increasingly unstable. Roads, pipelines, airfields, etc. are being rendered unusable because of it. Wildfires akin to what have been plaguing Canada this year have been burning in Russia for the past several years.

Could that be what is really driving Russia to continue a war that seems to offer no chance of worthwhile success? As climate change progresses, more and more of Russia is becoming less and less habitable and productive due to the melt.

I'm not saying it is the sole factor driving this war, but if the Russian government sees an inevitable loss of productivity across vast stretches of its territory it would explain a lot of why they continue to pursue it. It also would mean that they can't stop or give up the drive for territory, if not in Ukraine then elsewhere. I'm not sure that people have looked at this war in the context of climate change, most views seem to encompass only political and narrow economic reasons for it.

I've noticed that in the past 30-40 years, hourly measured air temperature consistently rose faster than night temperatures. The graph is from Frankfurt in Germany and I checked several other weather stations all over Germany, of which all show the same pattern: The average growth rate of temperatures is 40% higher during the day than during the night.

Is there an explanation for that? 

I would expect that if the composition of the atmosphere was responsible for the warming of the climate, then the temperatures during the day and night should be rising in a much more parallel manner. This way, it would make much more sense to blame the sun on at least 40% of the temperature increase.

Every Skeptics Argument on Climate Change and the science to disprove it,67,futurecomputer3000,1693512520.0,85,0.89,166lizu,climatechange,False,"Please  note that the arguments below lack strong scientific support and  have  been widely debunked by the scientific community. The prevailing   scientific consensus strongly indicates that human activities, including   fossil fuel burning like oil, significantly drive climate change. This   is extensively supported by global climate scientists.

Also,  Let's not forget Internal documents from ExxonMobil came to light,  revealing that the  company had information about climate change as  early as the 1970s even though they funded misinfo like seen below.  That's only one example , but i will save that for another post.

**Each Falsehood debunked**

1. **Natural Climate Variability**:  Some argue that the Earth's climate has undergone natural fluctuations  throughout its history, including periods of warming and cooling, long  before human industrial activity. While it's true that natural  variability exists, the rapid and unprecedented increase in greenhouse  gas concentrations since the industrial revolution aligns closely with  the observed rise in global temperatures.
2. **Solar Activity**:  Skeptics sometimes point to variations in solar radiation as a  potential driver of recent climate change. However, scientific research  has shown that solar activity has not increased significantly in recent  decades, and its contribution to the observed temperature rise is  minimal compared to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions.
3. **Urban Heat Island Effect**:  Skeptics might claim that urbanization and the heat generated by cities  are responsible for the observed warming, rather than greenhouse gas  emissions. While urban heat islands can influence local temperatures,  they are not the primary driver of global temperature trends, and  climate models take their effects into account.
4. **Incomplete Historical Data**:  Some skeptics argue that the historical temperature data is incomplete  or unreliable, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions about  human-caused climate change. However, extensive efforts have been made  to address data quality issues, and multiple independent datasets  corroborate the warming trend.
5. **Natural Carbon Emissions**:  Certain individuals may suggest that natural sources of carbon dioxide,  such as volcanic activity, release far more greenhouse gases than human  activities. While volcanic emissions are significant, they are much  smaller than human-caused emissions and do not explain the recent rapid  increase in carbon dioxide levels.
6. **Climate Models' Limitations**:  Skeptics often highlight the uncertainties associated with climate  models to cast doubt on the accuracy of their predictions. While models  have uncertainties, they have consistently projected the observed  warming when accounting for a range of factors, including human  emissions.

The  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and numerous scientific  organizations worldwide have concluded that human activities,  especially the burning of fossil fuels, are the primary drivers of the  rapid and unprecedented changes in the Earth's climate. Addressing  climate change is a global challenge that requires collective efforts to  transition to more sustainable energy sources and mitigate its impacts.

**But wait, Co2 is good for plants, right?**

Elevated  CO2 levels from human activities potentially benefiting plants  oversimplify complex ecosystem interactions and disregard negative  outcomes:

* **Diminishing Returns**: Initial benefits decline as other factors like nutrients, water, and temperature limit plant growth.
* **Imbalance in Ecosystems**: Rapid CO2 increases disrupt species balance, altering ecosystems and stability.
* **Nutritional Impact**: CO2 alters plant nutrition, affecting herbivores and omnivores that rely on them.
* **Heat Stress**: CO2-related temperature increases harm plants, negating positive effects.
* **Ocean Acidification**: Excess CO2 causes ocean acidification, threatening marine ecosystems.
* **Extreme Weather**: CO2-driven climate change intensifies hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, impacting plant life.
* **Pollination Disruption**: Climate change disrupts pollination, hurting plant reproduction and crops.
* **Biodiversity Loss**: CO2-linked disruptions lead to habitat loss, jeopardizing biodiversity.
* **Long-Term Consequences**: Unchecked CO2 emissions risk ecosystems, biodiversity, and human well-being.

From the Comments: ""**Greenland melted 400,000 years ago and had nothing to do with CO2""**

Certainly, let's address your concerns and provide some insights on why climate change is a real and pressing issue:

1. **Greenland's Historical Melting**: The natural climate variability that caused Greenland's melting 400,000 years ago isn't mutually exclusive with our current understanding of climate change. Today's situation involves a combination of factors, with human-caused greenhouse gas emissions being a significant contributor. CO2 levels have varied in the past, but the rapid increase since the industrial revolution is driving current changes.
2. **Ice Core Data and Boreholes**: Science is an evolving field, and advancements like the correction in the ice core method showcase its self-correcting nature. The consensus remains that human activities are causing current climate changes. Borehole measurements complement existing data, adding to our understanding of past climates.
3. **Climate Models and Predictions**: While there are various climate models, they consistently show warming trends linked to increased CO2 levels. NOTE: Media using RCP 8.5 might highlight a worst-case scenario to emphasize the urgent need for action. The broader consensus across models supports the reality of climate change.
4. **IPCC and Future Projections**: The IPCC's projections provide a range to account for uncertainties. While error margins exist, the consistent trend of warming and its impacts on ecosystems and species cannot be ignored. Making informed decisions based on the best available data remains crucial for our future well-being.

From the comments: ""**Less CO2 in the air means so much oxygen that we will die!** ""

While climate change and oxygen levels are separate issues, it's  important to clarify that the current atmospheric oxygen level is not a  concern for human health.

I’d like to provide some thought out ideas. 

Which is why I’m here, looking for like-minded people to initiate meaningful discussion and action on climate migration. I have done some research and would like to share what I have and get other people’s unique ideas, insights and perspectives and discuss things starting with Optimal Relocation Sites  
 More specifically -  Based on available evidence, where are the best locations to consider for climate migration? Which areas are likely to be least threatened by the effects of climate change over the coming years? Are there essential infrastructure and services nearby? Is the area prepared for a potential influx of people in the short and long term? Things to consider for long term sustainability?  (BTW shout out to The Reliance School who is on this sub.

Why Arctic has warmed a lot and Antarctica not.,1,Honest_Cynic,1693445420.0,107,0.52,165x443,climatechange,False,"A major question and one I posed here several times, with no reasonable answers.  Indeed, this is the major defect of climate models, that most of the globally-averaged warming is due to an annual-averaged temperature increase in the Arctic and N. Europe, whereas little warming in the Southern Hemisphere and none in Antarctica.  Yes, modelers added ad-hoc additions like changes in the Polar Vortex to make their models fit past data, but no certainty that will give valid predictions for the future.

I ran across this 2020 research paper which studies the issue.  Note they also state no appreciable melting of Antarctic ice, despite continual claims in the media.  The paper runs computer models to try to understand.  Their conclusion is that the high elevation of most of Antarctic land (ex. 11,000 ft plateau at South Pole) blocks the flow of humid air which is said to flow stronger to the North Pole due to climate change (added to fit data?).  Interesting that they make no mention of the feedback effect of melting sea ice exposing more dark ocean to absorb the sun's rays, which is said to account for 30% of the warming in the Arctic.  Antarctica is surrounded by a large area of sea ice, so wonder why not also significant there.  Their modeling shows that if Antarctic ice was at sea level, like at the North Pole, the warming from increased humid air flow would only increase Winter temperatures rather than Summer.  Not a bad thing, though we don't get to vote, plus Antarctica is not lowering.

Not sure this paper gives a reasonable explanation, but is an attempt.  Feel free to give your thoughtful comments, for those able to read and process information, not just ""believe"".  Just posting ""denier"" isn't thoughtful.  Not my research paper, just throwing it out to readers.

The planet is experiencing wide-spread environmental degradation and destruction that falls under the umbrella of that term but which sometimes gets overlooked. 

An article from the NY Times begins: ""Global warming has focused  concern on land and sky as soaring temperatures intensify hurricanes,  droughts and wildfires. But another climate crisis is unfolding,  underfoot and out of view. Many of  the aquifers that supply 90 percent of the nation’s water systems, and  which have transformed vast stretches of America into some of the  world’s most bountiful farmland, are being severely depleted. These  declines are threatening irreversible harm to the American economy and  society as a whole.""

In other words, the US is has overpumped and overused its groundwater; acquifers --  the underground resevoirs that we get our water from. -- are shrinking. We are draining them  past the level they are able to replenish and once they are gone, we will have no water left. ""Nearly half the sites \[surveyed\] have declined significantly over the past 40 years  as more water has been pumped out than nature can replenish."" Even a casual reader very likely has read reports of communities in the Southwest literally running out of water or farmers having their irrigation water cut off because there just isn't any more water.

5) Depending on toxicity/voltage, the ground remains available for human use (hiking, parks, etc), unlike traditional solar farms.

There are an average of 3.04 trillion trees in the world with an average processing capacity of 20 kg CO2 absorption per tree per year.  
   
Global CO2 emissions are approximately 36.4 billion metric tons per year (36.4 trillion kg).

Percentage = (Global CO2 Emissions / Total CO2 Processing Power of Trees) \* 100

Percentage = (36.4 trillion kg / 60.8 trillion kg) \* 100 ≈ 59.74%

Therefore, current global CO2 emissions are approximately 59.74% of the estimated total CO2 processing power of all trees on Earth. This suggests that the collective capacity of trees to absorb CO2 through photosynthesis is significantly greater than the current level of CO2 emissions produced by human activities.

This image is Figure 11.9 in the IPCC WGI 2021 report. It shows how hot and cold extremes have changed globally in the last 6 decades. What I notice here is that the annual coldest temperatures have increased much more than the annual hottest temperatures in general. That is, cold extremes have decreased much more than hot extremes have increased. Is this common knowledge? It was new to me. I thought it was pretty much equal, imagining a bell curve that is shifted to the right on the temperature axis. But this implies a more narrow temperature distribution and that the increase in mean global temperatures is more driven by the reduction in cold extremes than the increase of hot extremes.

So then I read the article about the AMOC potentially slowing down and collapsing this century, and that this would lead to significantly lower temperatures in northern Europe.

We have been deforesting our earth for human's selfish desires for millennia and, most importantly, we have completely destroyed the oceans through overfishing.

There was a time just 200 years ago when the fish were so numerous in rivers that it seemed like a man could hop across without getting wet.

Next time I’ll just use screenshots, lol. 

I’m qualifying “worst” as biggest departure from baseline conditions. 

Let’s get into it. 

Here is a map of average daily temperature anomalies across the globe in [May](https://climatereanalyzer.org/research_tools/monthly_maps/output_png/era5-0p5deg_56.png). This anomaly is compared against the average May temperatures between 1971-2000.

Here is [July](https://climatereanalyzer.org/research_tools/monthly_maps/output_png/era5-0p5deg_62.png)

I want you to now think about how fires have moved across the Canadian landscape this season. 

They began in the west in BC, Alberta, and Saskatchewan in [May](https://zoom.earth/maps/satellite-hd/#view=42.2,-92.4,3.68z/date=2023-05-20,pm/overlays=heat,fires)

In [June](https://zoom.earth/maps/satellite-hd/#view=43,-82.6,4.43z/date=2023-06-25,pm/overlays=heat,fires), while these fires continued, Quebec became the hotspot and dumped huge amounts of smoke down into New York. 

In [July](https://zoom.earth/maps/satellite-hd/#view=52.9,-109.6,4.54z/date=2023-07-25,pm/overlays=heat,fires) the Northwest Territories became the new hotspot. 

These maps should display orange heat anomalies where the fire is at. Sometimes it’s finnicky, feel free to pan around, to change the day, etc.  

There’s a better way to display these fires but this is just the quickest for me. Plus you can explore them yourself. 

Notice anything? 

The pattern of fire intensity followed the pattern of heatwave intensity! 

Notice how the May anomaly is concentrated in the west, how the June anomaly emerges in Quebec, and then how the July anomaly moves north. (May also had a big anomaly in the north but in the far north May is still very early spring).

Makes perfect sense when you consider scientific findings that the most important driver of fire activity in western North America is the aridity of the forest: https://imgur.com/a/KFhLLGA (such a powerful correlation visualized there).

"What is the best resource/article/material that explains how to think about extreme weather? Regarding the topic of extreme weather, it's hard for me to understand how to conceptualize things.",10,LinguisticsTurtle,1692479236.0,7,0.92,15vrpcl,climatechange,False,"You can look at heatwaves and wildfires. In Canada they are obviously shattering all wildfire records by a huge amount. 

Regarding heatwaves, you can ""roll a 7 on the dice"" such that you're experiencing heat that literally was not even *possible* before global warming heated things up...or you can end up with a ""loaded dice"" such that the events are occurring more frequently but the events were still *possible* in a cooler world. So I guess that all makes sense. 

But look at some of the shocking heat that we've seen in South America. Is the idea that that heat would've reached *almost* to the levels that we've seen but that climate just ""tipped it over the edge"" such that the record was shatter? That's what's confusing; if climate change *contributed* to a record-breaking never-before-seen weather event then that contribution could be quite small and then the idea is that even without climate change the event would've been like a nearly-unprecedented and shocking thing but maybe the record would've remained intact. So that aspect of partial contribution is confusing. 

Then it's the same issue with the Canadian wildfires. It's totally apocalyptic; Canadians have never seen anything like this, though in recent years the people living in like British Columbia and Alberta have seen a lot of destruction and everything. But if climate is only *partially* contributing to what we're seeing right now in terms of wildfires then is the idea that the wildfires would still be catastrophic in an unwarmed world but just not quite *as* bad?

>The ongoing intensification in forest fire activity in California has had a dramatic impact on human activities and ecosystems alike. While an increase in temperatures and dryness has been identified to be one of the major drivers of increased summer forest burned area (BA), the extent to which such changes are due to natural variability or anthropogenic climate change remains unresolved. Using the latest simulations for climate change attribution and detection studies and accounting for the uncertainties arising from the data-driven climate-fire model and climate models, we quantify the influence of anthropogenic climate change on recent changes in BA. We show that nearly all of the observed increase in BA over the past half-century is attributable to anthropogenic climate change.

...

>Record-breaking summer forest fires have become a regular occurrence in California. Observations indicate a fivefold increase in summer burned area (BA) in forests in northern and central California during 1996 to 2021 relative to 1971 to 1995. While the higher temperature and increased dryness have been suggested to be the leading causes of increased BA, the extent to which BA changes are due to natural variability or anthropogenic climate change remains unresolved. Here, we develop a climate-driven model of summer BA evolution in California and combine it with natural-only and historical climate simulations to assess the importance of anthropogenic climate change on increased BA. Our results indicate that nearly all the observed increase in BA is due to anthropogenic climate change as historical model simulations accounting for anthropogenic forcing yield 172% (range 84 to 310%) more area burned than simulations with natural forcing only. We detect the signal of combined historical forcing on the observed BA emerging in 2001 with no detectable influence of the natural forcing alone. In addition, even when considering fuel limitations from fire-fuel feedbacks, a 3 to 52% increase in BA relative to the last decades is expected in the next decades (2031 to 2050), highlighting the need for proactive adaptations.",True,False,False,False

"Looking for Resources to Form a Cohesive, Comprehensive Argument to Present to Skeptics",7,Tri-angreal,1691801665.0,50,0.89,15oqaw7,climatechange,False,"Hey folks, TL;DR at the end.

I've been confronted by a number of folks who are yet to be convinced both that the climate is changing unusually, and that humans have a significant impact on that change. In conversation, I found myself unable to articulate the supporting argument to their (and more importantly my) satisfaction, and unable to cite specific sources or studies or results with supporting data.

So, a little unnerved at my irrationality, I went looking online.

And I am struggling to find anything that isn't propaganda. Everything I can find either presents a biased argument appealing to pathos and ethos, regardless of which side of the debate it comes down on; or which simply makes claims ex cathedra that the climate is changing as if it's a foregone conclusion. There're a lot of articles that assume climate change is real, and then tell the reader what they should do about it, but they *don't present the sources or data that back up that assumption.* At this point, I can't find any debate that isn't politicized into meaninglessness. I don't like presenting either side of an argument as idiots, because that immediately surrenders validity.

The rest present such a narrow slice of the science that it's too easy to dismiss. Like changes in a single lake's water level, or yearly temperatures in one city, or a single graph of temperatures with wonky axes, and only going back a century or two. I just got done reading an article that supported climate change, which mis-represented its graph entirely by pointing out the exact opposite conclusion that the graph suggested. Not a good look.

I know climate change is man-made; I've seen the comprehensive data and studies before. I just can't find them again to refresh myself enough to argue effectively.

So, assuming that my struggle is more a result of my poor google-fu than an actual lack of data, where  can I find a good review of literature presenting the evidence for and against the argument that climate change is anthropogenic? The best kind would be one that eschews emotional appeals and does not exhort the audience to action; just one that lays out in clear terms the evidence that lead scientists to conclude that we're having an effect, and what that effect is, and the mechanisms thereby.

A good textbook would also be acceptable. I just don't want to rely on the junk pop-sci propaganda that our side of the debate has devolved into. I don't need an advertisement to convince the masses to act; I need a bibliography to convince rational but so-far skeptical people.

**TL;DR. Want to find a good summary of supporting (and contradictory would be good--presenting both sides strengthens the argument) evidence including data and methodology for the claim that climate change is happening and is human-caused, which I can refer to quickly when asked to support that claim. Would prefer one that is without appeals to emotion and which does not seek to incite action, since these things can stink of rhetoric and weaken any arguments I want to make.**

**Basically, I just need a bibliography.**

Anyone know a good resource?

These emissions are  already in the atmosphere, fueling climate change and extreme weather  and jeopardizing public health and ecosystems across the globe. The Hubs  are expected to ensure meaningful community and labor engagement and  contribute to the President’s [Justice40 Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/).  Together, these projects are expected to remove more than 2 million  metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions each year from the  atmosphere—an amount equivalent to the annual emissions from roughly  445,000 gasoline-powered cars—and create 4,800 good-paying jobs in Texas  and Louisiana.

How to causally link weather events to increasing global average temps above baseline?,12,kylecmarshall,1691705378.0,62,0.78,15nq29p,climatechange,False,"Disclaimer: I have been a skeptic for many years, but I decided to actual dig into the scientific bases for global warming and climate change.

I started with how global temperature is actually measured and compared over time. Its was easy to see that the global average temperature above baseline is increasing and that increase has accelerated since 2000. Compelling cases were made that its was tied to industrialization and started at the industrial revolution.

In graduate school, I studied control theory and system dynamics. You learn that everything has its own response time. How long does it take something to react to a new stimulus? So I asked myself how fast is the response time of the environment to pollution stimulus? I read John Sterman's Ph.D. thesis ""Feedback complexity in integrated climate-economy models"". Not a light read at all. Inspired by the World3 model, he devised an economic model of the world coupled to a physical simulation of the climate (how pollution affects air/ocean temperature, how temperature affects the environments uptake of pollution, etc...)

You can see in his thesis that the environments response time to pollution is 50+ years. Meaning that if I instantly inject massive pollution into the environment, it would take about 50 years for the temperature to reach its maximum before it starts to decrease again. The pollution also decreases interesting enough by ocean sequestration. You can also clearly see that pollution caused by using natural resources lowers energy supply and effects the economy.

Okay so my next step and my biggest leap over my personal biases is to try to see climate change in terms of global warming.

Is there any scientific or academic research that can explain how global average temperature above baseline increases or pollution increases causes specific weather events to occur? Or is there a criteria that must be met before a weather event can be attributed to global warming?

This is a very difficult task to do. If you have ever studied chaotic non-linear system dynamics, you will learn that very simple systems can start to produce very complicated behavior. The double-rod pendulum and the lorentz attractor are common academic examples. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos\_theory#/media/File:Double-compound-pendulum.gif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory#/media/File:Double-compound-pendulum.gif)

Global weather modeling is a very chaotic system. The temperature error when forecasting the daily weather increases linearly by day and by day 12 it is about as accurate as an almanac at predicting the temperature.

I'm having a hard time reconciling all of this to see the climate activists point of view. It just seems really hard to link mathematically and practically weather events specifically to pollution / global warming.

He elaborated on how coral reef damage makes the coastlines way more vulnerable to storms (which is the cause of the rapidly spreading fires)

Climate change is real and I think we should be more considerate of our environmental footprint regarding our daily choices. Something as simple as the sunscreen you choose can make a huge impact. 

Avoid sunscreens that contain: *avobenzone, butylparaben, ecamsule octinoxate, oxybenzone or 4-methylbenzylidine camphor*.

Instead choose a physical sunscreen with *non-nano zinc oxide* or *titanium dioxide*. (Also there’s lots of great information on the internet or use ChatGpt for advice😉)

Urgent Rescue Operation Underway as Bridge Collapses in Northern China due to Devastating Floods,12,areemiguel,1691140350.0,1,0.88,15huym5,climatechange,False," Hey fellow Redditors,

I hope you're all safe and sound wherever you are. Today, I came across some distressing news from northern China that I felt compelled to share with you all. According to state media reports, a highway bridge in Taipei collapsed due to flash floods triggered by heavy rains, causing two cars to plunge into the river below. Thankfully, there have been no reported casualties so far, but the situation remains critical.

Images published by local media show the aftermath of the incident, with the two badly damaged cars floating in the water. The bridge collapsed early this morning, and rescue operations are currently underway. As a result, a section of the Harbin-Mudanjiang Highway has been closed to ensure the safety of the public.This unfortunate incident is just one of many occurring across China as the country battles some of the worst floods it has seen in decades. Beijing, the capital city, recently experienced its heaviest rainfall in over 140 years, turning streets into canals and leaving emergency crews to navigate the city using rubber boats to rescue stranded residents. Tragically, two rescuers lost their lives in separate incidents while trying to save others.

The impact of these floods extends beyond Beijing. Zhuozhou, a small city in Hebei province, has been severely affected, with over 125,000 people being evacuated. In Heilongjiang, where the bridge collapsed, water levels on the Mayi River have exceeded safety levels, indicating ongoing risks of further flooding. Authorities in the eastern Shandong province have also warned of rising water levels on the Zhangwei River.While China was fortunate to be spared by Typhoon Khanun, which wreaked havoc in Japan, the country continues to face challenges as it battles the aftermath of these devastating floods. Water supply has been restored in Mentougou, a district in western Beijing that was severely affected, leading to the evacuation of thousands.In times like these, it's heartening to see organizations stepping up to help. Apple, food delivery app Meituan, and China's Red Cross Society have pledged donations to support relief efforts in the affected areas.Let's keep the people of China in our thoughts and hope for a swift and successful rescue operation.

Before digging further myself, I thought it was a good idea to ask here, if anyone can reference an article were such calculations were done and compared to empirical data.

Considering climate change as I think of future careers,24,bethanoia,1690759260.0,26,0.93,15dzrma,climatechange,False,"Hello, I'm a 19 year old girl from Brazil who, as most peiple in this community, is getting very worried about my future in this earth with the way everything is going. One thing that I've been thinking a lot recently is my career path. I am currently in my second year of majoring in Biology. I've always had a passion for nature and animals, and I chose this because I wanted a job that felt meaningful to me - and Biology seems even more important with all these current climate change consequences we have going on. 
However, in my country Biology is a rather difficult career path. Many people graduate and don't manage to land jobs, or are paid poorly. Or I could also go the academia route, which would last for about 7 years and also doesn't pay that well. Most of the jobs for biologists here come from environamental licensing (you basically aid a company to hurt the environment slightly less), which I feel like also doesn't make much of a positive difference to the world.
With all the pessimist talk I've been thinking of the importance of having enough money to prepare for dire situations in the future: having enough for food, shelter, air conditioner, prepare for disasters etc. Having enough to save for retirement. I come from a middle-upper class family and so I've never had to worry much about those things, but in the future I definetely will as the world enters a climate crisis.

Or should I go for a more stable career that would pay better, that I could work from home (which is good in case of extreme climate)? I've considered working as a programmer for this case.

After AMOC shutdown - if/when it does,14,phred14,1690746453.0,9,0.85,15duhzt,climatechange,False,"There are dire warnings about AMOC shutdown, and of course there is ""The Day After Tomorrow"", which is probably at least an exaggerated timeline.

But I'm having a different feeling at the moment, and that is that when the existing AMOC shuts down, something else will start up - a new circulation pattern.  My impression is that one of the specific fears is that melting of the Greenland glaciers will reduce the density of the North Atlantic and prevent those waters from falling as they have been.  I don't know how troubled Alaskan / Siberian glaciers are and if that part of the circulation pattern is in imminent danger also.

As a for-instance, if the falling water around Greenland shuts down and Europe gets colder, might the surface water begin falling closer to Europe?  The point is that if some other circulation pattern starts up, it may become persistent and ""reversing global warming"" (by whatever means) may not bring things back to the way they were.

I think so and here's why: it's about saving nature (forests), not about saving people. Regardless of whether carbon capture is effective, at least the funding is going to forestry. Once we are gone it will be nice to have at least preserved the most of nature as possible.

Not one real scientist believes in it, no meteorologist ever mentions it; nobody can hand you statistics and scientific data to demonstrate proof of change.

Battling Deadly Wildfires in Greece: Updates and Urgent Alert!,25,OnjoSimson,1690619269.0,2,0.94,15cmxdx,climatechange,False," Hey fellow Redditors,I hope you're all doing well. Today, I wanted to bring your attention to the ongoing fight against the devastating wildfires in Greece. The situation seems to be improving, but we must remain vigilant as fierce winds are forecasted, which could potentially rekindle the blazes.Currently, hundreds of courageous firefighters are battling flames on various Greek islands, including Rhodes, Corfu, and Evia. Additionally, a new front has emerged in central Greece, adding to the challenges faced by these brave individuals. It's not just Greece; fires have also flared up in Croatia, Italy, Portugal, and Algeria, claiming lives and leaving landscapes tinder dry.According to the Greek fire service, there are currently no spreading fires, and the situation is improving. However, they remain on a war footing to contain the ongoing fires. Just yesterday, more than 130 people were evacuated by boat from a town in central Greece after fires caused an explosion in an ammunition warehouse. Thankfully, the blaze has been contained, and residents have started returning home, although the force of the explosion shattered windows.The impact of these wildfires is immense. Tens of thousands of residents and tourists have been evacuated, disrupting the busy travel season. Rhodes, a popular holiday destination, has even declared a state of emergency. Tragically, we have lost four lives in this battle, including two pilots who died in a plane crash while fighting a blaze in Evia.Greece has been enduring an unprecedented heatwave for over 10 days now, with temperatures reaching a scorching 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) last weekend. Thankfully, the temperatures have started to fall, but the National weather forecaster EMY predicts strong winds of up to 60 kilometers (37 miles) per hour today.Let's take a moment to appreciate the bravery and dedication of the firefighters who are risking their lives to protect others and combat these wildfires. If you have any updates, personal experiences, or suggestions on how we can support those affected, please share them in the comments below. Together, we can raise awareness and extend our support to Greece during this challenging time.Stay safe, everyone!

Are temperatures this summer hotter than scientists expected? Thoughts from a climate scientist.,48,-explore-earth-,1690381948.0,79,0.9,15a7gt1,climatechange,False,"I thought this article was super helpful for contextualizing this wild year of climate records.

It's hot, but is it hotter than climate scientists expected? 

Some nuance is added for global air temperatures, sea temperatures, and regional sea temperatures (in one case we can say is exceptional). 

Personally, while this is a great description to help lay people understand, and it sort of calms fears that the climate system is doing something truly unexpected. 

However, it's no great comfort to me, seeing as how where July 2023 falls at the very top of the probability distribution will some decades in the future actually be at the coolest end of the distribution.

There is an alternative which I think is useful, which is probably closer to something like anthropology.

You can take climate change and place it within a larger history of technological innovation by the human, in the broadest sense. That includes the process of settlement and development of urbanization -- city building. That process included humanity becoming sedentary rather than nomadic. Where once before humans could move to a new location in the event of climatic change, we are now largely locked in place, all 8 billion of us.

In the course of history we developed short-term security against climatic events -- through the process of city-building and urbanization -- but in the process we made ourselves more vulnerable to severe, long-term climatic changes. This is because now we can't go anywhere, only lock ourselves away in engineered environments until urban planning changes on a massive scale.

This is one reason why you can't separate climate change from questions of technology and politics...and primordial human emotions that have to do with security and power. 

It's all interconnected is what I'm saying.

Picture me, M17, wanting desperately to get involved in climate action and to actually be on the right side of history, feeling like I can’t enjoy my holiday in Italy because all the bad news about the climate is messing me up mentally. I’m reminded of it daily with the blistering heatwave, and i really dont want to turn my back on climate action while i’m here. I feel like if I relax here, on holiday, i’m being temporarily yet mortally complicit, and I don’t forgive myself. This is completely messing me up…


My question is, well there are two questions

A) Is this true? Am I being mortally and selfishly complicit here if I take my mind off it?

B) What the hell can I do while i’m here?

C) How else can I get involved? I’m very anxious about direct action, but i’m a keen singer, I find writing speeches natural, and i’m known to my local representative as he’s given me tickets to parliament several times, I can and have raised it with them

Some examples:

* The floodwater wasn't a problem right up until it reached the level to flow into the subway system, whereupon it causes billions of dollars in damage
* Impacts from the heatwave were not an enormous problem right up until they caused the grid to fail
* The drought only harmed us in linear fashion right up until the moment that there was not enough water to go around, even including our cuts in usage
* The trees are stressed linearly by the heatwave right up until the critical moment that the water column in their vessels [ruptures](https://www.npr.org/2012/11/23/165667600/an-arbor-embolism-why-trees-die-in-drought), causing most of the forest to die

For me, the response is a simple and obvious one: In the deep past when there were climatic changes, humans were largely nomadic, so they could pack up and move somewhere else if there was drought, flooding etc. But now there is \~8 billion of us living in sedentary economic urban conditions. Moving somewhere else is impossible for almost everyone. But people will have to move eventually by absolute necessity, and it will cause geopolitical division and conflict.

How does this sound, am I missing something in my reasoning?

I am guessing there could be a counter response that the nomadic, adaptive capacity, is replaced by a technological capacity. But, not everyone will have the economic ability to rely on technological responses, such as engineered environments.

 Hotspots beneath cities deform the ground, causing important infrastructure to crack under stress 

The streets, sidewalks and roofs of cities all absorb heat during the day, making some urban areas up to six degrees Fahrenheit hotter than rural ones during the day—and 22 degrees F hotter at night. These “[urban heat islands](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/risk-of-dangerous-heat-exposure-is-growing-quickly-in-cities/)” can also develop underground as the city heat diffuses downward, beneath the surface. And basements, subway tunnels and other subterranean infrastructure also constantly bleed heat into the surrounding earth, creating hotspots. Now that underground heat is building up as the planet warms.

According to a new study of downtown Chicago, underground hotspots may threaten [the very same structures](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44172-023-00092-1) that emit the heat in the first place. Such temperature changes make the ground around them expand and contract enough to cause potential damage. “Without \[anyone\] realizing it, the city of Chicago’s downtown was deforming,” says the study’s author Alessandro F. Rotta Loria, a civil and environmental engineer at Northwestern University.

The findings, published on July 11 in *Communications Engineering*, expose a “silent hazard” to civil infrastructure in cities with softer ground—especially those near water—Rotta Loria says. “There might have been structural issues caused by this underground climate change that happened, and we didn’t even realize,” he adds. While not an immediate or direct danger to human lives, this previously unknown effect highlights the impacts of a lesser-known component of [climate change](https://www.scientificamerican.com/climate-change/).

And don’t forget about the developing countries, which should continue to increase their CO2 emissions until they reach western living standards.

So, let’s try to think of more drastic ways in which we can try to save the planet and humanity from the climate crisis.

I’ll begin:

The Pandemic has taught us that with enough political and societal will, we can take effective measures to greatly decrease emissions, all it takes is will from both the Governments and the people. Restricting international flights and increasing remote work are the easiest ones. Also, transitioning into a mostly plant-based agriculture system, reducing the work week, etc. 

Even restricting international flights for only half the year could be good, or having “quarantine”-like months or a week per month, like we did in the Pandemic, but without the social isolation.

Of course, this won’t come without a cost. My country’s economy is heavily reliant on tourism. Without international tourism we’d lose many jobs. Governments would need to prioritize meeting the basic needs of the population, such as food, water and shelter. Maybe through UBI. But that would require a huge cultural shift.

[OC] I Built a Web App to Map and Visualize Global Carbon Offset Projects ~ 7500 Projects,15,Zolroth,1688056281.0,6,0.95,14m9js2,climatechange,False," [www.offsetmap.com](http://www.offsetmap.com/)

Two years ago, I started investigating the complex world of carbon offsets , specifically in Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU). At the time, I was conducting climate research and I quickly recognized the absence of a convenient tool for efficient data comparison across regions, project types, and databases. The absence of such a tool slowed down my work and highlighted a wider issue of information accessibility for carbon offset data.

In response to this, in 2023 I developed [www.offsetmap.com](http://www.offsetmap.com/) , an online platform bridging this information gap. It provides a user-friendly interface for rapid, global carbon offset data comparisons, catering to various project and regional interests. It's a free service aimed at benefiting the larger environmental community. Whether you're a professional researcher, a sustainability professional, a student, or simply curious about carbon offsets, I invite you to try [www.offsetmap.com](http://www.offsetmap.com/). I share this resource in the hope that it will be beneficial to many of you, aiding your research, studies, or simply satisfying your curiosity.

Not all carbon offset projects are created equal. And you can see that in the data, looking through the credit retirement data across all the registries you can see clearly how some project types have been widely accepted and bought, while others have been left behind (with many millions of unsold credits).  As the technical negotiations for Article 6 continue, it will be interesting to see what kind of projects will be promoted. 

The web app works best on desktop, but it should still be functional on mobile!

Some changes made in the last month!

1. I have added interactive charts with credit retirement data. The charts are made on the fly with the actual retirement data for each project, so what you see is actually based on the serialized retirement data for each credit transaction.
2. I have completely reworked the Icon system, now it is based on a three icon grouping of Nature-based projects, Energy/Efficiency projects, and Industrial projects. The icon size relates to the size of estimated annual emission reductions attributable to the project. The sizes of the markers are based on the statistical distribution of all the projects. Additionally, I have added project titles below the markers.
3. Usability improvements such as improvements to the Legend, document linking, button aesthetics, project count, and more regular database updates.

If you're curious to learn more about the project their is a blogpost linked at the bottom of the map (i symbol).

Thanks for reading all that! Please let me know if you have some feedback regarding future/current changes.

Why is there (seemingly) a preference towards calculating the global mean temperature anomaly relative to 1961-1990 instead of 1850-1900 (i.e. pre-industrial levels),6,AsHotAsTheClimate,1687900556.0,29,0.88,14kpsxj,climatechange,False,"The global mean temperature anomaly is often used as a reference of how Climate Change is evolving. It's used in pretty much every Climate Accord and every time Climate Change is mentioned in the news, the latest value of the global mean temperature anomaly is referenced. This being said, its very rare (in a non scientific setting) for the mean temperature anomaly to be mentioned without telling the period of time it is relative to. Depending on the period chosen, the value is slightly different but given the scales, that difference is significant.

Why does there seem to be a preference towards using the 1961-1990 period as a reference? My limited understanding makes me thing it's more ""accurate"" to look at the pre-industrial period as GHG emissions were so low that they had little to no impact on the Climate. Is it because the pre-industrial times had a colder climate if we look at a longer time period (say 1000 years)?

It discusses (what the writer perceives as) a shifting trend from (what is described as) alarmism to something she appears to think is more moderate and realistic. The essay harks back to the infamous article for New York Magazine by David Wallace-Wells [The Uninhabitable Earth](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html) and then mentions a more recent backtracking he has made on his apocalyptic predictions in his newer piece for the New York Times titled [Beyond Catastrophe: A New Climate Reality Is Coming Into View](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/26/magazine/climate-change-warming-world.html). 

I'm wondering what the general consensus is on this shifting view:

\- Is the reality and science a lot less starkly horrifying that most people ""in the know"" including me and my partner (who works in sustainability) have been lead to believe?

\- Whereas 'alarmist' takes have their purpose as a response to the information and an attempt to reverse it, could this new way of framing the topic signal an acceptance of that horrifying reality, and an attempt to lessen anxiety (for either writers, readers, or both) as that reality approaches?

\- Or could it simply signify (as many commissioned pieces do) what messages that those paying the highest want to put out into the world?

Small introduction, I was raised in a conservative family and among the many tenants I was brought up under, “global warming isn’t real” was one of them. Now, I’m not disparaging my family, and I’m quite proud of how they did their best to raise me, and I still am comfortable and confident in many of my beliefs that I’ve established for myself in adulthood (I say this not to start any political debates, but to try to head off any “glad you escaped, they’re so backward” comments. Not why I’m here, please keep those kinds of politics to a minimum out of respect for others and the sub’s rules.) 

So all of that said, I’m really trying to be more open minded and aware of things, and I would like to read up more on the current science, the evidence we have for the current science, and general projections of what it looks like regarding climate change. What are we doing that’s causing damage, what can we do to fix the damage, what does the damage even look like, that sort of thing. 

My only request is that the resources be as unbiased as possible. Again, I’m not trying to be political, and that’s not what I mean by this. I just mean that a resource from someone’s “climate blog” or some such—even if they’re easy to understand and correct—will be very offputting to me if they’re also really preachy about it. I’d like to start with facts before getting too deep into someone’s opinions on those facts. 

I promise this is coming from a place of genuine interest and open-mindedness, I just know myself and will probably be *more* put off by a climate doomsday preacher (no matter their accuracy) than I would by scientific publications or less biased science communicators. 

So any help y’all can provide would be welcome! Journals, unbiased blogs, articles, YouTube videos, Netflix documentaries, hit me with your best stuff. Please!",True,False,False,False

So a map that uses these sorts of calculations:

1. First a rolling 7-day difference in temperature is calculated (difference between highest high and lowest high, or conversely the highest low and lowest low)
2. Over a year, how many 7-day-differences show variations of more than 10 degrees? 20 degrees? Conversely, what are the places with the most consistent temperatures within any given 7-day period?

As someone who's interested in settling down somewhere with low climate variability (regardless of whether the average yearly temperature is increasing) I would find such a map very helpful.

Another few maps in this vein could be:

* A map showing number of times the threshold between freezing and thawing is passed, but only after eliminating streaks of such threshold crossings that last more than 7 days (which would hopefully eliminate normal seasonal changes from showing up, thus highlighting anomalies)
* A map showing number of rain events over the past 5 (or however many) years that exceeded the monthly average.

"""Climate Change is Junk Science"" - Senator Gerard Rennick",87,chedzz,1662342502.0,94,0.84,x63s8f,climate_science,False,"According to a Facebook post published by Senator Gerard Rennick 4 Sept -   


Climate change is junk science. 

The science of heat is governed by the laws of Thermodynamics. 

Heat is kinetic energy, the energy of motion - it does not get trapped by CO2 because it’s a gas. 

Yet this is the theory pushed by the climate change alarmists. 

To describe the impact of CO2 as being like a greenhouse is farcical. A greenhouse works by using a solid object to trap convection before the air cools and condenses. CO2 is not a solid object. 

CO2 absorbs and emits radiation. It does not trap convection. Furthermore it absorbs and emits incoming radiation at 2.8 microns while only absorbing outgoing radiation at 14.8 microns. 

Applying planks rule e = hv, the incoming radiation absorbed by CO2 is 5 times more powerful than the outgoing radiation absorbed. 

Regardless, as Einstein said in 1917, the amount of energy transferred by radiation is so small it always drops out. 

The most powerful form of heat transfer in the atmosphere is convection which is governed by the second law of thermodynamics. The entropy of a system must always increase. 

As such hot air will rise not fall. Outer space is negative 270 degrees Celsius. Our atmosphere is always losing heat because of this differential.

GWP* or GWP100 for accounting for methane emissions from cows.,8,lijas,1662195234.0,2,0.73,x4pr7r,climate_science,False,"I have been reading a bit about GWP\* lately. For you who dont know what it is, here is a paper discussing it:  [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6d7e](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6d7e)

[(or you can watch this explanation)](https://youtu.be/Gw7_qwT6IVI?t=296).

GWP\* is a way of determining the Global Warming Potential of GHGs based on changes in their emission rate. Lets look at the the methane emissions from cows as an example. If a countries cow population is kept constant, than the methane emissions from the cows would not further increase the global temperature, because the methane in the atmosphere is eventually broken down in to CO2. And since the total CO2 emmisions is not increased (due to the gases being in a closed system), the total warming potential of the methane from cows would be zero.

This would greatly affect how we rank food based on their environmental impact, which would make beef not look as bad as before.

Any insights/opinions in to GWP\* vs GWP100 would be interesting. Which one is ""better""?",True,False,False,False

* Daily we emit 117 million tons of CO2. Global CO2 emissions are 43 billion tons each year. [\[S\]](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
* As CO2 concentrations build in the atmosphere, infrared light radiated from earth's surface is absorbed by the CO2. Thus trapping heat in earth's atmosphere. This is known as the greenhouse effect. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect)
* 38% of global CO2 emissions have dissolved in the oceans. When CO2 dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid. This is known as ocean acidification. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_storage_of_carbon_dioxide) [\[S\]](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/feel2633/feel2633.shtml)
* The ocean has 50 times more CO2 than the atmosphere. The ocean has 39,000 billion tons of CO2. The atmosphere has 750 billion tons of CO2. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub)
* As the ocean becomes more acidic, less CO2 is able to be stored in the water. This leads to CO2 being released from the ocean and sent to the atmosphere. The same goes for ocean temperature. As water temperature rises, less CO2 is able to stay dissolved (e.g. leave a carbonated drink out on a warm day). [\[S\]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016RG000533)
* As temperatures rise, soil begins to increase the release of carbon in a process known as soil respiration. Researchers estimate soil carbon loss over the 21st century will be equivalent to two decades of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. [\[S\]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan2874)

# Solutions:

* **Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE):** Use mafic and ultramafic rocks (olivine, peridotite, etc.) to bind to CO2 and form carbonates. Thus converting CO2 into an alkaline carbonate mineral. These carbonates could then be placed in the ocean to raise the pH and bring it back to normal levels, and increase CO2 storage capacity in the ocean. [\[S\]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08561) [\[S\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00007/full)
* **Direct air capture (DAC):** Use large fans to concentrate CO2 into a chamber and then absorb the CO2 by various means. The CO2 can be converted into a long term storage medium such as a carbonate or left as vapor CO2. In the case of vapor CO2 there is some commercial value or it can be pumped into geological wells for storage. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_air_capture)
* **Renewable energy:** Wind, solar, geothermal, wave/tidal/marine power, etc. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy)
* **Cultured meats:** Growing meat from cell cultures instead of factory farming. This would free up billions of acres globally, democratize access to protein sources, and eliminate CO2 and CH4 emissions associated with factory farming. In the United States 41% of land use goes towards grazing and animal feed crops. These areas of land are usually high in sunlight and could be used for solar, wind, afforestation, or DAC. [\[S\]](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/land-use-land-value-tenure/major-land-uses/) [\[S\]](https://cellbasedtech.com/lab-grown-meat-companies) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_agriculture)
* **Reducing fossil fuel emissions:** This can be done by scrubbing some of the CO2 from the source before emitting it to the atmosphere. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber)
* **Afforestation:** Afforestation is the establishment of a forest in an area where there was no previous tree cover. Tree-planting campaigns are sometimes criticized for targeting areas where forests would not naturally occur, such as grassland and savanna biomes. Afforestation can negatively affect ecosystems through increasing fragmentation, edge effects, and making the surface albedo darker (especially in northern regions).

What effects can lakes have on precipitation?,13,a694-reddit,1651708255.0,3,0.94,uik1me,climate_science,False,"I'm pretty interested in alternate history and specifically I've thought a lot about alternate nations in the western United States. Said area is very dry and is currently undergoing a drought, so I've thought of some alternate lakes that could exist in the area. But I'm not sure if they would actually have the precipitation effect I think they may have.

The two lakes are as follows:

1. Lake Cahuilla, which is effectively just the entire Salton Sink filled up. This lake existed not all that long ago but doesn't anymore. It's area would be around 5,700 sq km and it's in a very dry and high evaporation area.
2. Lake Idaho. This is an ancient lake that existed in the north-west area of the snake river valley in Idaho. It was around the size of lake Ontario. 

So the big question that I have is this. What would these lakes, if they existed today, possibly do to wetten the western U.S.A, both in their immediate area aswell as longer range effects. Could areas like the (un-submerged) snake river plain and other areas of Idaho be made lush by the massive lake? And would the surrounding mountains around the salton sink, and thus the water issue in the Colorado, by improved by the existence of lake Cahuilla.

I'm thinking a coomparison chart would help me but I'm not sure where to look for one. My partner is an engineer, with a core interest is advanced math, he can translate the things i don't understand if lots of calculations is involved.I ask because I weave, crochet and knit and there are ways of doing it with sustainable materials plus making our own garments makes it easy to make exactly what we need when we need it instead of buying lots of cheap garments on sale that eventually ends up in fabric dumps in remote deserts. Often clothes are made in factories far away that pollutes a lot and consumes lots of energy that could be saved for all the obvious reasons. I realize not every one can knit their own socks but plenty can. And with socks from the right type of materials, a sweater and a scarf we don't all need 24 degrees c or higher inside all the time.  We certainly don't in our family. It takes about two days to knit a pair of good socks for my youngest but only two minutes to buy a stack of cheap socks every time I loose one sock in the washer.

I realize it doesn't save the world knitting a pair of socks as such. But I know I don't need the same amount of Putins gas as before I knitted them. A rainbow scarf I wove on a strong wooden loom  will outlive me probably, due to the strength of different types of animal fibers in the yarn I used for weaving it.

Sustainable fibers for yarn or fabrics are worth a discussion of its own, and diffictult, and I've adjusted what I buy a lot myself.

Question on the Basics of Atmospheric General Circulation Models,13,jlhawn,1648589085.0,4,0.9,trn7s3,climate_science,False,"First, some background. About 10 years ago I took a physical geography class at UC Berkeley about climate systems. We learned a lot of the basic things like Earth's energy budget and atmospheric circulation (Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar Cells, ENSO, Coriolis effect, etc.). Since my study major was actually Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and not geography, for the final project of this class the professor allowed me to make a very basic energy balance model written in JavaScript (so it would run in a web browser). At the time, dealing with the physics of fluid circulation seemed too difficult and out of scope so I didn't even attempt it. This model was very basic in that it modeled the surface of the earth as a 2-dimensional grid with a resolution of only a few degrees of longitude and latitude. Each grid cell was designated as either ""land"" or ""ocean"" which were given different values for albedo and specific heat capacity. Each grid cell had a unit vector normal to the surface which was modeled as being flat. There was a global unit vector which pointed in the direction of the sun and would rotate around the earth's rotation axis once every simulated day. The time step was 30 minutes. Using the solar constant, the model would calculate the amount of radiation absorbed and reflected by a surface cell given its position and this heat would be transported across the surface at different rates depending on whether the cell was land or ocean and calculate a new temperature for that location. There were a few other parameters which controlled the rate of radiation emitted back into space. Over time, a balance would be reached where the average global temperature would fluctuate around a stable value with the day/night cycle.

Anyway, I now have the of time to study how to make a very basic atmospheric circulation model. I don't need or expect it to be an accurate model of the earth. At the moment, I am not interested in modeling ocean circulation or even the humidity. I am only interested in modeling a uniform spherical surface with dry air as the fluid. This sphere will be heated by radiation which comes from a direction that rotates around the sphere as in the energy balance model described above. The major difference is that now I want to model the fluid dynamics on the surface of this rotating sphere. I have a pretty good understanding of the forces that act on moving fluids on a rotating body like the Coriolis effect, pressure gradient force, gravitational force, etc., and I'm confident that I can program anything once I understand it, but, in attempting to read up on how an atmospheric general circulation model works, I am running into issues with my understanding.

I quickly found out that atmospheric circulation models *do not use height (z)* as the vertical coordinate. Instead they tend to use pressure coordinates. This is useful because pressure decreases monotonically with elevation so that given a surface pressure and temperature gradient with pressure we can calculate the height in meters above the surface. This is why weather maps for winds at different ""heights"" use millibar (or hectopascal) heights. From what I have read, the great thing about using pressure as a vertical coordinate is that it's easier to write a model which assumes hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction, i.e., the pressure gradient and gravitational forces are balanced (I understand that this isn't exactly *correct* but is a good assumption to make at *synoptic* scale). Using pressure coordinates also allows us to model horizontal flow using a *geostrophic approximation*. So ""horizontal"" is actually horizontal with respect to a constant pressure surface.

That brings me to the part that I do not understand. If the model assumes hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction, how can there ever be any vertical motion? Can there be a net acceleration in the vertical direction under the assumption that the pressure gradient force is in balance with the gravitational force? **edit**: To attempt to answer my own question, I think the explanation is that by using pressure as the vertical coordinate we sacrifice knowing or caring about vertical positional velocity in *meters per second* to instead only consider pressure velocity in *pascals per second.* Is this the correct way to understand it?

And if every direction in the horizontal has the same pressure, how can there be any net acceleration in the horizontal direction? There would be no pressure gradient in the horizontal direction!

I must be fundamentally misunderstanding something about how these models work. Can someone please help me to understand? Thank you.

From looking at the Wikipedia article on [Primitive Equations - Presssure Coordinates in Vertical, Cartesian Tangential plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_equations#Pressure_coordinate_in_vertical,_Cartesian_tangential_plane), It looks like horizontal acceleration is also supposed to depend on changes in *Geopotential* with respect to changes in horizontal position along a constant-pressure surface. So maybe I need a better understanding of how geopotential relates to pressure and temperature.

This raises another question though, which is how do I keep track of where the sphere's surface is on a vertical pressure scale? If the pressure at the surface changes (though is generally somewhere around 100,000 Pa) does that mean I need to keep track of ""where"" the surface is along the vertical scale for a column of air too? If so, how? **edit**: To attempt to answer my own question again, I think this also has to do with the concept of *Geopotential* which should be zero at the surface of the sphere. I haven't been able to find any equation for the Geopotential as a function of pressure and temperature, but there is an equation for the *partial derivative* of Geopotential as a function of pressure and temperature.

What are some climate policies that started in California and scaled to the US or beyond?,9,0x768,1648075321.0,3,0.72,tlj8oc,climate_science,False,"In my reading about climate change, I stumbled on some cases where clean-air and climate-change policies started in California and then scaled to other places.

* In the 1960s, California adopted CAAQS, which regulated airborne pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. In 1971, the US EPA enacted a similar policy called NAAQS, which applies to the whole United States. (admittedly these substances aren't really greenhouse gases, but they're still pollutants that are worth reducing.) \[1\]
* In 2002, the California Air Resources Board passed AB 1493, which limits tailpipe emissions from cars. By 2006, 10 states had adopted the same policy. \[2\]

"Is a stable climatic state with a Northeastern Asia with far warmer, wetter winters possible? More generally, is climate almost fully geographically/orbitally determined, or is it possible for alternate stable climate states to exist?",15,GrantExploit,1647848012.0,1,0.82,tj65rd,climate_science,False,"I've been developing, on and off for the past nearly 10 years in some form\*, a speculative evolution and alternate history scenario based on this main premise:

**What if the Siberian Anticyclone was a far weaker/less permanent phenomenon, leading to the climate of Northeastern Asia being significantly warmer and wetter in winter†, i.e. generally more North American?**

The problem is, the geography and Milanković characteristics of the Earth are supposed to be nearly identical to that IRL. Indeed, significantly changing it would defeat the point of the timeline—it features an alternate *Asia*, not a continent that somewhat resembles Asia—and would be largely impossible given the Point of Divergence of at earliest 880 kya.

Also, while I know that it *may* be possible for mass-extinction-level events to create new climatic equilibria, there also isn't a mass extinction in the scenario. So... ***is this even possible?***

I can see 2 possibilities:

1. Geography, orbital, and broad atmospheric characteristics almost always overpower and dampen even the most exceptional (sub-mass-extinctional) ""initial weather state"" conditions. This would be good because it would indicate that the climates of my patently fictional worlds (along with alternate geographies) would be able to be strictly and accurately predicted, but would effectively kill the aforementioned project.
2. An exceptional but sub-mass-extinctional ""initial weather state"" (i.e. pressure and wind patterns, temperatures, ground albedo, momentary atmospheric concentrations) can result in the transition to a new stable climate state, despite geography and orbital characteristics remaining the same. This would have nearly the opposite effect—while supporting the project mentioned, it would make determining the climates of my patently fictional worlds (along with alternate geographies) much more difficult.

Also, while I'm open to any answers, I would really appreciate it if people with genuine scientific credentials and/or trustworthy  sources could respond.

I know that climate change is not a binary issue with one or two endings, and I know that accurately predicting Human behaviours is incredibly difficult, so I'm not expecting a perfect answer to this question. 

Having said that:

Based on our current level of emissions, the positive feedback loops we have been able to identify and the direction society seems to be heading, what are the best and worst case scenarios for the environmental crisis? More specifically, within the near to midterms- say 2030 to 2100.

Most of the optimistic scenarios I've seen bandied about involve a sudden political and social shift all over the world; leading governments to rapidly implement all of the Glasgow climate pledges, electrify the grid, cut back on animal agriculture and attain net zero prior to 2050, before using carbon capture and reforestation to restore the Earth back to preindustrial health.

As wonderful as this would be, and as much as we should strive for something like it, it also seems incredibly unlikely. While environmental policies and activism are improving, I can't really see this all happening in such a short time.

On the other end of the spectrum you also have radical pessimists who believe that it's already too late to do anything and that tipping points will devastate the entire planet within the immediate future- leading to the collapse of civilisation by the 2040's (or as soon as 2026 in the most extreme cases) and an end to all life on Earth.

Again, this doesn't seem to be supported by any legitimate scientist. In fact, it has been suggested by several scientists that both blind hope and doomism have been weaponized by the corporate media as a means of sabotaging genuine action.

If we fail to cut back on our emissions and other destructive activities over these coming years and decades, is it plausible that Humans could become extinct? Could positive feedback loops actually render the entire planet uninhabitable?

How can we attain the organised action necessary to get us to a happier ending? What steps do we need to be taking to mitigate global warming, beyond electrifying the grid and phasing out fossil fuels?

&#x200B;

My main question is, how do we know how much impact humans are having on the climate. Not whether we are, or are not...but by how much.

I've seen the NASA graphic that shows how much more CO2 is in the atmosphere over the last 50 years, but are we using a different form of measurement in modern history versus how we speculate/measured it over generations before which could learn to large margins of error? This is possibly not true at all, but these are the types of questions I'm seeking to understand.

Also, I'm under the impression that other major climate changes were due to variations in orbit and so therefore there are other potential impacts on climate change outside of CO2. This would put some level of uncertainty on what magnitude of impact we have on climate change due to other outside factors?

&#x200B;

I assume there is not an exact amount that we can correlate human impact to climate change, but I'm curious at what level of certainty are we with what level of magnitude? Are we 99% certain that we are the cause for 75% of the temp increases, etc.? I assume that confidence level diminishes the higher we hypothesize the impact.

&#x200B;

Any insight would be great! Or if I need to move to another area for understanding, let me know!

On the one hand, as we all know, climate change is a crisis of enormous proportions and I completely support their intentions (I do not want to get into a discussion about methods). 

On the other hand, something that troubles me is that their namesake argument, that climate change represents an ""extinction level threat"" to humanity (with similar messages consistently used in their campaigning) or will lead to the collapse of human civilization is, to put it mildly, not supported by the evidence. In _Global Catastrophic Risks_ (2008), Frame and Allen conclude that, whilst immensely damaging, climate change _""would not necessarily be catastrophic in the sense of being a terminal threat""_ and since this book's publication, I have yet to read a paper arguing that climate change represents an extinction-level threat for humanity.

Of course, the error that Extinction Rebellion (and similar groups) is making is the assumption that the threshold of a catastrophe is human extinction. This is clearly not true because something can be catastrophic to human society (which climate change is) whilst not posing a literal threat to our existence (which climate change does not, or at least there is no evidence for this). 

My question is, is this actually a problem, or is this just academic pedantry? Putting my role as a scientist aside, my worry is that making claims that are _technically_ incorrect (even though the broad message that climate change is catastrophic is correct) makes it easier to deny campaigners' arguments over technicalities rather than actually engaging in the substance of the argument. Or similarly, that laypeople will just dismiss them as fanatics/hysterics. On the other hand, their campaigning does seem to be quite successful (a lot more successful than us climate scientists making technically correct statements on twitter and university press releases) and I haven't actually seen anybody using this counterargument I'm worrying about.

New here. How can I find the following data please ?,31,zagdem,1634141070.0,4,0.97,q7ed9d,climate_science,False,"Hi,

I'm looking for ways to persuade people to take action against the climate crisis (I think we all are). In order to do that, I'd like to express the crisis in non technical terms, but rather than that, in human lives. 

Here is what it would look like :

>Dear fellow human. You probably know that we, as a society, have to reduce our CO2 consumption under X1 ... but if you're like me you don't know what that means. Well, for you, it means that your target should be X2 = X1/numberofhumans. That's equivalent to (blablabla). Is that more clear ? Well, no. I know.  
>  
>So let's frame it otherwise. The consequence of the climate crisis will be very bad, and people will die because of it. How much of them ? Well, it is hard to count, but we can give a reasonable estimate. It turns out that you being personally responsible for a CO2 target of X2 is equivalent to being responsible for the death of X3 adults, X4 children. Worse, X5 time more humans are gonna face war, starvation, or migration to a distinct country because of it.  
>  
>That's a lot of responsibility on your shoulders, and the bad news is, your individual action (being vegan, not using your car, ...) can only cover X6% of the reduction you need to do. The next (100-X6)% has to come from corporations, governments, etc... So, if you care about the lifes of the X3 adults and X4 children you are personally responsible for, you have to fight for them.  You have to force your leaders, governments and companies, to change everything. They can't fight for themselves now. You can. You are their only chance. Do it.

Now, in order to write that with actual figures, I'm looking for the following data :

* X1 - What is our current CO2 consumption, and what it should be (I believe I can find it in the IPCC report. Is it a good source here ?).
* X2 - Easy one, all I need is the number of humans. I can handle it :)
* X3, X4 and X5 are hard. Here, we need to convert climate scenarios into geopolitical ones. Are there scientists who have worked on this, and can provide reasonably realistic estimates (I mean, even order of magnitudes ones). Also, I'm aware I'll need a set target date for this. 2040 ? 2050 ? 2100 ? I think I'll go with the data we have here, depending on the source we can find.
* X6 - What percentage of the CO2 effort can come from individual action (not eating meat, etc...). I believe I've read that the value is around 25%, but I need a source.

I hope some of you can help find this data. It is a small piece of text, but if we can build this, we can also convert any CO2 measurement into an individual count of lifes. It changes the communication game imo.

Thank you for your help,

Regards,

*Note : I'm also aware of a strong bias depending on whih country we're talking about. The world as a whole ? The US ? Europe ? Canada ? The figures aren't the same. That said, I'll take any help you can give, and I'll see what I can write depending on the data we have ... or not :)*",True,False,False,False

During the most extreme periods (e.g. the times immediately following the Huronian and Cryogenian glaciation and possibly the end-Permian), a total lack of glaciation *may* make sense, but I struggle to imagine how other greenhouse periods like the mid-Cretaceous, or the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum with its ""mere"" 8 °C warming would fit that description, because of the *sheer margin* by which some places remain within thermal conditions conducive to glaciation on present Earth.

For instance, both Vostok and Plateau Station (at \~3,500 meters elevation) could warm by a whopping *32 °C* before their warmest-month averages peak above freezing. Even if the temperature anomaly at the poles was 3 times greater than the global average, it would seem to me that mountains analogous to the Gamburtzevs (which peak at \~2,700 meters elevation underneath that vague area of Antarctica, equating to being at most \~8 °C warmer according to the temperature lapse rate) should still be able to support alpine glaciation let alone just seasonal snowfall under PETM-like conditions.

And given that locations with winters at least as as warm as Tampico (average temperature in coldest month 18.8 °C) have recorded snowfall while no places with average coldest month temperatures below \~7 °C haven't, the idea that *any* planet cool enough to avoid a Venusian-style runaway greenhouse effect with vaguely Earth-like orbital and rotational properties would *entirely* lack snow and frost appears patently ludicrous.

> We [""sceptics""] note that there are many reasons why the
climate changes -- the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth,
as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence
that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor. But actually there is much agreement between
[the scientific
part of the UN's IPCC - i.e. the Working Group I - (""group one"") and scientists who do not regard anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions as an especially serious problem (""group two"")]. The following are such points of agreement:

>1. The climate is always changing.
2. CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life
on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming.
3. Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century.
4. Over this period (the past two centuries),
the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees
Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960’s have man’s greenhouse
emissions been sufficient to play a role.
5. Given the complexity of climate, no confident
prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC, acknowledged
in its own 2007 report that “The long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.” Most importantly, the scenario that the burning of fossil fuels
leads to catastrophe isn’t part of what either group asserts.

Given the calibre of the ""sceptic"" in question, is the only recourse to verify in the literature each claim - even implicit and general ones that, in turn, contain further claims - in order to see which ones are demonstrably false and post a rebuke with references? Or is there a reasonable wholesale approach in these cases?

Tipping points: when does a 10% chance become a 100% certainty?,44,Tliish,1627508091.0,3,1.0,otjlin,climate_science,False,"The links are to good articles on the subject on Grist and Quanta.

In the Grist article, a number of climatologists talk about the tipping points in their respective fields, a decent array, but by no means a majority of the fields encompassing climate change.

A frequent risk assessment of individual areas is put at somewhere around 10% or less probability of occurring, with some discussion of cascade events, one breached tipping point leading to another, but despite the idea of tipping points, all the climatologists still seem to think that changes will be slow on human time scales. But while any individual tipping point may have a low to extremely low likelihood of occurring, if you have enough low-probability possibilities, you wind up with a near 100% chance that *one* of them will happen, which has the potential to raise the probability that others will be more likely to occur.

What I wonder is what happens if a heat dome similar the recent one over Canada (which killed \~1 billion sea animals, likely a tipping point for that ecosystem), and the present one over the Kansas/Missouri/Oklahoma/Texas area, each very low probability events, were to settle over Greenland? It wouldn't need to be as hot to have a major effect: even 5-10C over normal for a week would have profound effects.

There are many other examples. Each month it seems that new factors/feedback loops we hadn't thought of keep emerging, like the melting of the permafrost leading to wildfires which leads to more permafrost melting.

The Quanta magazine article concerns discoveries made over the last decade about carbon sequestration in soils that upends the commonly held notions about how likely we will be able to find ways to put the carbon into it. The problem is that most climate models are using erroneous assumptions about that, leading to over-optimistic assessments.

My point in all this is that we need to stop thinking that severe climate change events are not likely to happen over the next five to ten years, and start assuming that we are currently in a worst-case scenario and act accordingly. If it turns out we overestimated the danger and actually had more time, all's well and good, the only thing ""lost"" is perhaps money. However, if we continue to act as if we were living in a less-than-worst case to much-less-than-worst case, and allow several tipping points to be breached, we won't be able to recover.

Climate change is neither linear nor uniform. Some regional climates are changing much faster than others, and tipping points are far too close for comfort, some timeframes for them are within the margin of error. The entire world needn't hit 2-4C of warming for massive changes and problems to occur. If some regions hit that, then the likelihood of cascade events become far higher.

Encourage climatologists wherever you can to stop talking in terms of centuries and millennia when they discuss climate change, that just makes people dismissive of the subject, because the average person and politician don't care what happens in a century, much less in 10,000 years, they care about what happens this year, next year, and next decade at most. we need to focus on what's happening now, what's going to happen next year, and the next decade, because that's nearly all the time we have left to slow things down enough to have a decent chance at survival. Targeting 2050 is near-suicidal at this point, it virtually guarantees 2C+ of warming by 2040.

We really and truly don't have much time left, and what time we do have can be radically altered if we hit any of those tipping points.",True,False,False,False

How would biomes in different climates change? For example: Would a temperate climate, such as Britain's, become more arid? How does research suggest it would change the landscape? Would vegetation die and leave dry lands or would it be substituted by vegetation that can better cope with the new climate?

Would you still be able to see the sun or would the sky be filled with a thick layer of clouds?

How would oxygen levels change? How could humans and animals adapt to those changes?

To me, it seems that the wider public can almost be split into three camps at this point:

There are the denials, who seem to be able to ignore reality.

Then there are the people who kind of realize that climate change is a major threat that needs to be dealt with. But as long as people fly a bit less and gradually switch to electric cars and do some fine tuning, everything will be fine. 

Then there are people who see it as an existential threat in the very near future.

I just feel that what would be needed to save humanity, would be a 180 degree turn. That there is no time to wait until 2050 or so to become carbon neutral.

Arctic ice is declining year by year. Mass extinctions are well underway. Permafrost is melting. Seasons have become less reliable. I live in Finland, and last year it is fair to say that we did not have a real winter. 

I am only 26, and yet I have seen a marked change even during my lifetime. Example: as a child and teenager, I used to play a lot of ice-hockey outside during the winters. Last several years the temperature has not been reliably below freezing for extended periods, so ice-hockey season has become weeks instead of moths. Instead of reliable less than -5, we often get spikes above 0, which ruins the ice. 

Silly example maybe, but that is an example of how I don’t understand how people don’t see what is happening right in front of our eyes.

I have read a fair bit of Guy McPherson, Paul Beckwith and others. I’ve also read that they are too alarmist, but I have not read any proper debunking of their positions. Especially global dimming seems to turn our situation to a catch-22, but that is almost never discussed in the mainstream.

Fundamentally, I am a person who wants to have a family at some point. But I have given up hope on that. I have also given up hope on reaching 40 years of age myself. For the last year and a half, I have become cynical and lived as if in hospice.

I am not new to climate issues. I remember first being disillusioned in 2009 when the Copenhagen summit was hyped up and then led to no action. 

I have tried to find optimism, but I have failed. I see Paris climate accord as a delusional hope, and yet almost all countries are even failing to keep on track with those demands.

I am a university student who is currently undertaking a paleo-oceanography project, primarily looking at oxygen isotope values captured in marine sediment cores.

I am wanting to do some kind of spectral analysis to see how well oxygen isotope values align with milankovitch cycles over the last 1.5Ma or so.

Initially I was wanting to use R software to do this, and I may find a way to do it, it's just that to my knowledge, to do this my time series data needs to be in equal intervals before undertaking spectral analysis.

Reading research papers on the topic it seems that paleo climate proxy data needs to be interpolated somehow before spectral analysis is done, or researchers normally use software specifically 
designed for dealing with unevenly spaced time series data.

Climate sensitivity based on models vs ice core data,19,Sabiba,1596326436.0,3,0.89,i22kyv,climate_science,False,"Recent [estimations](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/climate-change-equilibrium-climate-sensitivity-global-warming/) of climate sensitivity imply that the steady state temperature increase from a doubling of C02 above pre-industrial levels (560 PPM) is between 2.6C and 4.1C.  This is a similar although narrower estimate than other mainstream estimates.

I came across this [paper](http://www.highstand.org/erohling/Rohling-papers/2009-Rohling%20et%20al%20AAtemp-sealevel%20ngeo557.pdf) which looks at the relationship between global C02 and temperature from antarctic ice core data.  This [figure](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Antarctic-temperature-and-global-sea-level-closely-Rohling-Grant/6dce13db600210d9e5c3fd2cd44f7714da867f59/figure/1) from the paper plots C02 vs Temperature, and draws a trend line which intersects with 387 ppm C02.  The Temperature of this intersection is 16C above anthropogenic levels.  This [paper](http://www.globalcoral.org/_oldgcra/AOSIS%20Briefing%202009.pdf#page=6) references the figure and re-affirms the implication, mentioning that it will take thousands of years to reach this steady state.  The original paper mentions that one explanation for the difference of models with lower estimates is that the trend line could curve upward (like the low, middle, and high lines in green) rather than be straight, but even if that were the case, it seems extremely unlikely that, based on the ice core data, a C02 level of 560 ppm would lead to anywhere near as low as 2.6-4.1C.

The most recent period with C02 levels near present day of \~400 ppm was the [mid-pliocene](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/52/13288), which had ""a mean annual surface temperatures approximately 1.8 °C to 3.6 °C warmer than preindustrial temperatures"".  How did 400 ppm yield a much lower temperature than implied by the [chart](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Antarctic-temperature-and-global-sea-level-closely-Rohling-Grant/6dce13db600210d9e5c3fd2cd44f7714da867f59/figure/1) of ice core data, especially considering the ice core chart has data points of 3-4C with C02 less than 300 ppm?  Even if the Mid-pliocene data gives a more accurate climate sensitivity, it seems it would be a much higher sensitivity than what present day mainstream modelers are suggesting, i.e. mid-pliocene implies 560 ppm would lead to higher temps than 2.6-4.1C.

How will climate change affect winter storms and swell?,8,bottles24,1595684014.0,4,0.84,hxmsby,climate_science,False,"

I asked a similar question in r/surfing a couple of months ago:

How will the pole‘s ice melting affect the low pressure systems, known in the surfing world as ground swell( huge storms traveling between 30 degrees latitude and 60 degrees latitude),especially in the northern hemisphere?

With the ice of the poles melting, the temperature difference between the poles and the mid lattitudes in the air will likely decrease. This will in turn produce less big storms in Winter, which will ultimately produce less ground swell all around the world, but in particular in the northern hemisphere. Here the ice is melting first. 

That’s what i think could be happening. I read articles that stated storms will get more extreme. But i think that is only true for tropical storms. 

What do you think?
How will this affect the waves and Surf all over the world? In particular Europe and Northern America ? Do you agree with my hypothesis?

Assuming this is referring to pre-industrial levels, then does that mean that current warming (at the moment and if we can sustain it to 2 degrees) is on par with the Eemian?

EDIT:

1980-2003 Natural variation in latent heat flux,22,DrDolittle,1580974879.0,4,0.87,ezoy9q,climate_science,False,"Much of modern warming occurred between ~1980 and ~2000, [HADCRUT](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/HadCRUT4.png) puts warming at +0.5°C, and as I shall argue, the magnitude of temperature increase cannot be fully explained by either changes in solar output (1W/m2 output) nor increased CO2 (~1W/m2 surface).

Ocean **surface vaporization** and associated **latent heat flux** [\[1\]](http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/climatechange1/07_2.shtml) is the fundamental [driver](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/52009254_The_Role_of_Water_Vapor_Feedback_in_Unperturbed_Climate_Variability_and_Global_Warming) of natural climate variability (see [Clark](http://venturaphotonics.com/files/CoupledThermalReservoir_Part_I_E_EDraft.pdf) or [\[ch3.4\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) for review of ocean thermodynamics):

- Latent heat flux is created as solar radiation heats ocean surfaces, causing vaporization. 
- Vaporization then cools ocean surfaces as ""latent heat"" and water vapor are transferred to the atmosphere.
- This process creates clouds and rain and upward air circulation and heats the atmosphere, and 
- the latent heat is transported by air currents to higher latitudes.

So latent heat flux transports solar radiation and water vapor from oceans to atmosphere and redistributes energy and water vapor. The amplitude of the latent heat flux process depends on the amount of solar radiation that reaches the ocean's surface, which again dependens on atmosphere albedo, clouds and aresols. Latent heat flux is fundamental in cloud formation and is proportional to surface wind speeds, both potential feedback loops. The effects on climate to a hypothetical change in latent heat flux is shown to be quite significant in [simulations](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/courseware/water-water-everywhere.html).

Latent heat flux **increased 10% or about 9 W/m2** from 1980 to 2003 [\[fig\]](https://imgur.com/a/GqIe3q1) [\[paper\]](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-88-4-527) [\[ch3:fig6\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) and this is **attributed to ""natural variations"" in AR5** [\[ch3.4.2.2\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) [\[paper\]](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00148.1). The magnitude of the increase excludes CO2-downwelling as the cause (ΔF = ~5.35×ln (373/338) = 0.52 W/m2 before feedbacks).

Changes in **ocean heat content** are significant as
- bulk of earth emissions imbalance (difference between earth incoming and outgoing radiation) goes to ocean heating, due to ocean's large mass and heat capacity [\[ch3:box 3.1\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/), and as
- continental warming due to human activity is believed to be [80-90%](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL051106#grl29030-bib-0009) dominated by indirect warming from oceans. 

Since 2003 the derivative of ocean heat content and the derivative of the earth emissions imbalance both appear to be declining \[[Fig15](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331886058_Decadal_Changes_of_the_Reflected_Solar_Radiation_and_the_Earth_Energy_Imbalance)\], and this decline corresponds with the 2003 peak in latent heat flux. Ocean heat content, earth emissions imbalance and latent heat flux all indicate that the cause of the 1980-2003 anomaly has subsided.

**""Global brightening""** is one plausible theory for the heat flux anomaly, the shortwave (solar-)radiation reaching the surface appears to have increased significantly over the period [\[1983-2001\]](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=18825) due to changes in clouds or atmospheric aerosols.

**Since the period 1980-2003 has a 0.5-1 W/m2 expected increase in CO2-downwelling, and a 9 W/m2 measured increase in latent heat flux due to ""natural variation"", much of the warming in this period must also be due to natural variation. Logically, this could have occurred in one of two ways:** 
- **increases in temperature and latent heat flux have a common cause, such as ""global brightening"", or** 
- **latent heat flux increase, what ever its cause, caused the surface warming.**

*Edit: the significance of global brightening is underlined by the observation that the last half of the 20th century is believed to be the period of highest solar activity in the last 8000 years [[figure]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sunspot-number-reconstructed-from-the-concentration-of-the-cosmogenic-isotope-14-C-after_fig1_258806419)[[paper]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258806419_European_Solar_Physics_moving_from_SOHO_to_Solar_Orbiter_and_beyond)*",True,False,False,False

Would Hydrogen fueled aircrafts be better or worse than kerosin fueled?,2,Griffonguy,1580316423.0,8,0.67,evpe3f,climate_science,False,"I always assumed that it would be a climate neutral alternative to regular planes but a few things got me thinking.
Water vapor is the main driver of the greenhouse effect and while regular planes emit both water and co2, a hydrogen plane would emit probably more water into the stratosphere since water is the only chemical reaction product.

Now it gets even more confusing for me. Afaik Water vapor is a transperant gas while clouds and artificial clouds from airplanes are already condensed water into tiny droplets. The vapor is a greenhouse gas but the clouds or droplets are actually having a positive effect because they reflect visible light coming from the sun.
Edit: apparently only low altitude clouds are having a cooling effect on the planet while high altitude clouds like these from airplanes are actually further contributing to the greenhouse effect.

Now the question is. What happens to the artificial clouds from airplanes? Do they evaporate and add to the amount of water vapor in the stratosphere?
If so, how big is that effect on the climate compared to the co2 emissions of a regular plane.

Can clear-sky measurements of CO2 radiative forcing be used to calibrate radiative forcing models?,13,DrDolittle,1579682868.0,1,1.0,es9b2t,climate_science,False,"*Can anyone here knowledgeable in climate science chime in and provide any feedback on why ""clear-sky"" studies like this can or can't be used in the manner described below? Any help much appreciated.*

The CO2 radiative forcing term is often modelled as

*Δ F=k ln(c/c0),*

where *k* in AR3 is *5.35* (page 358 in the ""WG1 physical basis"")*.*

Now in a 2015 Nature article by Feldmann *""Observational determination of surface radiative forcing by CO2 from 2000 to 2010""*, the radiative effect of CO2 was [observed](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14240) to be **0.2** **W/m2** over the decade for 2000-2010(see [Figure 4](https://imgur.com/a/OErknh0)), during which CO2 increased from 370ppm to 392 ppm.

This is 30% lower than what the IPCC model states:

*Δ F=5.35\* ln(392/370) =* ***0.309 W/m2.***

To approximate the result of the Nature article, the parameter  *k* should have been reduced to *\~3.6:*

*Δ F=3.6\* ln(392/370) =* ***0.207 W/m2***.

**Feldmann and co-authors appear to not have noticed or commented that the radiative forcing they found was low in their paper.**

ECS can be [split](https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/clip_image0022.jpg) into *pre-feedback climate sensitivity* and a *post-feedback gain factor,* and the radiative forcing of CO2 is a factor in pre-climate sensitivity.

**Thus a reduced radiative forcing estimate by 30% would mean that ECS estimates from IPCC models should be reduced by 30% as well.**

Challenging the CO2 minimum hypothesis,3,,1578280664.0,36,0.56,eknyhi,climate_science,False,"I would like some clarification of the following claims if some of you could spare the time:

We are at a CO2 minimum for geological time scale. As in 99.9999% of Earth's history had more CO2 than present.

When the Earth had 3,000 ppm (About 7 times the total concentration of present) there was more diversity of life, large plants, larger trees, and thriving eco systems.

The Earth literally had an atmosphere primarily composed of CO2 for the first billion years of its history. Algae in the oceans formed and absorbed it and turned it into O2.

The entire history of industrial activity for humans we have gone from 280 ppm to ~410 ppm. So we haven't even seen a single doubling of CO2 in our atmosphere.

The most CO2 has been released in the last 20 years than previous decades, yet global temperatures stagnated. Meaning CO2 sensitivity is greatly out pace by natural factors such as the PDO cycle.

The Earth saw cooling for 3 decades during 1940 to 1970 even though we saw CO2 rising across the globe. This is part of the reason people feared an ""Ice Age"" (Glaciation period) for returning.

Warming is not equally distributive, and actually happens more so towards the poles. Meaning even if the ""average temperature"" goes up, if you're close to the equator you will see no temperature change. This also means large swathes of areas in Russia and Canada go from being Tundra to farmable land. As in more food for the entire planet.

Plant life grows better at higher CO2 concentrations. Ideally 500-600 ppm would be where we slow down, as that will lead to better agriculture.

A glaciation period (some would call an Ice Age, even though we are in one right now) would result in vast death across the globe. Some estimate nearly a billion people would die. Meaning we should hope we are warming the planet to avoid another glaciation period.

Sea level rise has been going on for 20,000 years. And it is not accelerating. The current rate of sea level rise is 1-2mm per year. Meaning by the time populations are displaced will be over centuries, not years or even decades. Meaning humans who are good at adapting will adapt without even realizing they are doing so.

Am I correct in thinking that the primary greenhouse warming mechanism is:

- the molecule becomes more energetic and transfers it's energy to surrounding molecules via collisions 

And the secondary mechanism is:
- infrared photon emitted by the earth's surface strikes a CO2 molecule
- after some time that molecule may emit an infrared photon as a result.  
- if the direction of emission is downwards then the photon will either strike another CO2 molecule, or strike the earth's surface, warming it.

Complete newbie looking to learn more - Really appreciate any insights.,12,Tilasir,1572479162.0,21,0.93,dpf3y9,climate_science,False,"Sorry for jumping in - I couldn't find an FAQ or newbie type of thread. Ever since I heard Greta's speech (I know she gets a lot of crap online, but it greatly impacted me and helped me start to realize the scope of the problem) I have been in a complete panic for weeks. I am only 25 and it really got me thinking about the future, whether I want a child, or if its even worth it to plan for retirement. I am absolutely horrified about what IPCC will say in 2021. I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before. To add a bit of hyperbole, this post can be reduced to: *do we need to start preparing for a collapse of society or even extinction within the next 50 years?*

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics. I would like to see if you folks have a different opinion on the following.

\- It doesn't seem like society is going to collapse by 2050 due to climate change. At least IPCC and other sources don't seem to think so.  Do you know of any reputable scientists that think collapse is a likely outcome. I've read a few articles and posts that state scientists haven't said anything because of reputation risks - do you think that is likely?

\- I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory. Forgive me, I don't have a background in science and a lot of the peer reviewed papers are too technical for my understanding. Also this recent tweet about a spike in methane:  [https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758](https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758) 

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

\- Also, I know its long but anyone could help me understand how trustworthy Robert Walker is ([https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I would greatly appreciate it.

How do I respond to a video my family is circulating about Climate Science?,25,grapecure,1572469665.0,35,0.95,dpcvtc,climate_science,False,"This video is currently circulating through part of my family:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvO7bBuTRno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvO7bBuTRno)

I have watched the whole thing, and those of you in the know will probably already know Dr. Christy's main points without needing to rewatch. For those who aren't and would prefer some quick bullet points:

&#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.  
 

My question is, being an average person who reads the news as well as a small number of scientific papers, what do I tell these members of my family regarding what Dr. Christy is saying in order to help move them away from this? I am aware of all the basic facts about climate change, and more or less disagree with each of these bullet points; the challenge comes in because as far as these members of my family are concerned, it is basically my word as a non-scientist against the word of a real scientist, who despite his unfortunate stance on this issue, is an incredibly experienced scientist with an extensive resume, particularly when it comes to climate. His point about all the other scientific community being essentially part of a ""conspiracy"" plays right into their hands as well. The fact of the matter too is that I simply don't have enough knowledge or evidence on hand to dispute what he's saying, other than trying to remember that one article/paper I read whenever ago and trying to dig it out and on and on.

Now - looking at the climate change which is cascading through our weather systems - there's a chance we would lose the jet stream - right?  It could stall or move further south.

Should Working Group III be a part of the IPCC?,31,naufrag,1570210865.0,12,1.0,ddaose,climate_science,False,"There has been criticism by academic commentators that IPCC working group III, dominated by economists and political scientists, bears some responsibility for the absolute failure of the global community halt the rise in CO2 emissions and respond adequately to the crisis, due to severely underplaying of the risk of damages of the climate crisis and promulgation integrated assessment models that rely on the removal of hundreds of gigatons CO2 from the atmosphere by speculative future negative emissions technologies, in order to avoid the challenging problem of real mitigation today. 

The conventional wisdom that 3.5-4C of warming somehow represents a ""cost optimal"" level of heating (for which William Nordhaus was awarded the Economics Nobel) conflicts directly with results from physical climate science - yet appears to enjoy widespread acceptance among economists.

This presentation highlights some of the foundational problems with the conventional economic approach to climate damages put forward by Nordhaus et al: Prof. Steve Keen: [Economists should be removed from the IPCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=235&v=vwwvZ8g5eHE&t=36s&fbclid=IwAR0C8IQ0xV8OZEf92IFSc9TjyDnzQRsULKm8icN7LiBMvDi7XZREHHcuBI0) The conventional economic approach is misguided, based on made-up data, and following it threatens social disaster.

A slightly older paper but a very interesting paper nevertheless, I found it doing research for my upcoming posts on geoengineering.

As the Arctic ice melts, its reflectivity or albedo will decrease. This means that the exposed ocean will warm up more as a result of increased absorption of sunlight. This causes a positive feedback loop where:

Less ice causes the ocean to warm up ---> Warmer ocean water causes more ice to melt ---> More ice gets melted ---> Rinse and repeat.

However, it was believed that this would create a possible upside. Warmer oceans would allow phytoplankton to grow. As the phytoplankton grows, it will absorb carbon dioxide and therefore cool the earth down slightly. 

This paper shows that increased phytoplankton growth could amplify Arctic warming by 20%, causing devastating warming somewhere that is already warming twice as fast as anywhere else on earth. This causes another positive feedback loop where:

Less ice causes the ocean to warm up ---> Warmer ocean water allows more phytoplankton to grow ---> More phytoplankton growth leads to warmer ocean water and therefore less ice ---> Rinse and repeat.

If Elon Musk diverted his attention from putting people on Mars to placing a relatively large controllable satellite lens or group of satellite lenses in geosynchronous orbit close to the sun (say, in the planet Mercury's orbital path):

A) how much light would these need to let pass though to offset 450 ppm CO2 warming down to 350 ppm? In other words, is there a W/M^(2) 'coefficient' from incoming long-wave radiation transfer to GHG affecting short wave radiation, averaged across the different surfaces of the earth? For example,350 is 77.77% of 450, so would this hypothetical lens need to block 22.23% of incoming solar radiation to achieve the effect of dropping from 350 ppm to 450 ppm?

B) Photosynthesis requires long spectrum radiation (blue light) that not even clouds can block. Would blocking a certain amount of this incoming light reduce plant and algae CO2 uptake enough that it would neutralize any positive benefits from preventing this light from becoming short-wave radiation on earth? Is there more incoming long spectrum radiation than plants can use per square cm of leaf surface? I realize most of this long wave radiation is reflected or absorbed as heat by the surface of the earth: this is a question of do plants get more light than they need, so that as planetary thermostat managers we could afford to block a little incoming sunlight without sacrificing too much food production, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services?

c) Would blocking incoming long wave radiation produce changes to weather patterns due to less differential heating from the equator to the poles? Assuming the lens is uniformly transparent, would this be a problem?",True,False,False,False

A bit of an old one, but it seems every interesting. As you all hopefully know, DMS (dimethylsulphide) essentially cools the atmosphere. DMS is produced by phytoplankton, this study shows that due to ocean acidification (OA), DMS production will decrease, causing an increase in temperature up to 0.48°C.

As you can see in the graph above my text, the trend might either be very sharp, or more shallow, a more dramatic drop might be very bad, meaning that OA will cause a large decrease in DMS and thus a boost to global warming.


This is an interesting mechanism, not included by current models.

However, the jury is still out, this paper shows that while OA will decrease DMS production, warming will increase it.

However, the RF for CO2, CH4 and N2O are non-linear (log for CO2, square root for CH4 and N2O). Therefore the computation of GWP should depend on the concentrations over the N years, in other words on the RCP.

Comparing current GHG concentrations / forcing to RCPs,12,tmurdock,1563846241.0,2,0.94,cgm8ub,climate_science,False,"Does anyone know how to make an apples to apples comparison of ""how far along"" we are in terms of the RCPs? Is the current GHG concentration ""ahead"" or ""behind"" schedule compared to say RCP8.5, and by how much?

The reason I ask is that I'm a climate scientist specializing in local impacts for adaptation and risk assessment, and the folks who use our projections are increasingly asking about where RCP8.5 fits in terms of emissions reduction strategies and where we are at so far. I've generally viewed this question as a red herring but it's just coming up too much to not answer any more.

If you look at the values in Table 2 of [https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html) for Total Radiative Forcing they are larger than the historical numbers at [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=compare](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=compare) by about 50% in 1980.

Of course these aren't directly comparable as the NOAA paper is just converting concentrations with constants and ignoring feedbacks. So I suspect the main difference is water vapour feedback perhaps? The RCP database notes that total concentration exludes mineral dust and the effect of land albedo, however.

The difference between the two measures of total radiative forcing decreases with time and if you extrapolate from the 4 points of overlap it would be about 32% today. Applying this ratio seems to suggest that we are doing (a little bit) better in 2018 than RCP8.5 forcing by 2020 was projected to be. Does this sound about right? I had it in my head that we'd been emitting worse than RCP8.5 for quite some time now but maybe that was a few years ago and we've actually started turning away from this pathway a bit?

I'm wondering to what extent current models may indeed need to be updated and to what extent the updated models are likely to predict relatively less mean global warming by 2100? The last sentence suggests ""continuing La Nina-like trends"" which might imply somewhat lower warming though still extreme weather volatility (more droughts in one region, more rainfall in another)? Quote: ""However, the strength of the tropical Pacific influence on global climate implies that past and future trends will diverge from those simulated by coupled climate models that, due to their cold tongue bias, misrepresent the response of the tropical Pacific to rising CO2. Until state-of-the-art models more faithfully represent the observed tropical Pacific, climate impact assessments should consider the consequences for the global hydroclimate of continuing La Niña-like trends in tropical Pacific SSTs""

After reading a reddit post on r/all about CO2 levels reaching an all time high, I started to investigate more into the issue myself (all of the top comments were saying ""we're fucked"" and ""it's too late).  I did more research into American *news* articles and a lot of them somewhat confirmed what they were saying (if we don't have a global, coordinated push we could see the collapse of society within 5 to 30 years).

I stumbled upon this site after someone posted it as a source to validate their point and the information presented in it contradicts what I've said on subs like r/science, r/worldnews, r/politics, etc.  (I'm asking this sub because the majority of commenters here seem to actually study climate).

Does this site present a reasonable/fair explanation of climate change?

"Confusion over the climate change/global heating ""lag"".",19,,1561829727.0,7,0.95,c725j1,climate_science,False,"To start off I simply want to say I'm not a denier or skeptic, I fully believe that anthropogenic climate change is causing more than 100% of the current global heating and that it will have severe consequences, but I am a layman who wants to learn more.  


I've been reading about climate change for a few months and gotten a deep interest in it. However, I am confused about how the radiative forcing and temperature growth lag functions. From what I understand; Radiative forcing grows first with temperature growth following behind. It takes time for temperature growth to catch up with forcing (decades, centuries, millenia depending on TCS or ECS?).  


However, I am also having a hitch on how this functions when it comes to things such as high GWP and other atmospheric gasses. For example, as methane is initially 120x more potent than CO2 but has a very short half-life, wouldn't this practically nullify the lag for this gas and add immediate warming? Wouldn't this mean that if there was a large release of 10 GtC, wouldn't that immediately a lot of warming?  


Or things like nitrous oxide, wouldn't that practically add an immediate temperature boost without any real lag? Is there a period where a greenhouse gas absorption hits a ""peak"" before it starts degrading?

"Why did the global temperature go down by 5 degrees celcius 146M years ago when co2 went up by 50% at the same time, shouldn’t the temperature go up when CO2 goes up a lot? What factors prevented this?",10,Lambdal7,1561530842.0,8,0.66,c5meed,climate_science,False,"I saw this graphic and was wondering why CO2 often correlates inversely with temperature.

Does anyone know because of which factors 

1. Temperature went up by 8 degrees Celcius 600M years ago while co2 went down by 30%
2. Temperature went down by 8 degrees celcius while Co2 went up slighly 439M years ago
3. Temperature went up by 8 degrees while co2 didn’t move 270M years ago
4. Temperature went down by 3 degrees celcius while co2 went up by 30% 146M years ago
5. After that, temperature stayed stable for 120M years while CO2 went down

I get that CO2 traps heat, but why doesn’t it seem to correlate with temperature? Co2 only correlates with temperature once 300M years ago and 5 times it didn’t. How so?

But how are current CO2 measurements taken?  The way I see it (and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong), there are two ways to get comparable data from today.  

1) take ice core samples from the present day (1950-present), and use that as your CO2 benchmark  

2) ascertain that air samples (like ones from Mauna Loa) are equivalent to ice core samples in terms of CO2 concentration.  I imagine this could be done by letting water freeze in several chambers that vary by CO2 level, and then testing the CO2 level of the ice.  

If anyone could confirm that one of these is true, (or quell my doubt in any other way) I would appreciate it.  It doesn't strike me as trivial that the CO2 level of an ice core would necessarily be equivalent to the CO2 level of the ambient air at the time of freezing.",True,False,False,False

So I'm seriously considering changing careers to more directly help combat climate change. I'm somewhat overwhelmed trying to research all the options though. I'd love some help figuring out where I might be most helpful. 

My background: I studied molecular biology at a well respected university, spent a year in academia, in devopmental neurobiology (early nervous system development). I then left and started a social enterprise working in preventative mental health that's doing rather well. It's far from a unicorn, so I'm not loaded, but I've got credible entrepreneur credentials now. I'm not committed to leaving, but it's at the point where I could easily leave and the company would be fine.

Through that, I gained a good understanding of the literature around human behaviour change, albeit from a health and well-being perspective. I'm quite good at public speaking and talking about science (I used to tutor), but not at all experienced in debating.

I'm considering a few paths: 

* Science communication/journalism
* Going back to school for a masters that will set me on a relevant academic path. Biotech seems like a good compromise between potential impact and potential for transferable skills, but I'm very open to other options. Including more policy/behaviour change focused work. 
* Looking for a job with a promising climate start up that could use my help

I have never farmed before, nor have I raised fish - however I figured that with enough trial and error, I'd get the hang of it.

Of the supposed environmental benefits I can list elimination of supply chain & middlemen, some carbon absorption by plants, no pesticide, fertilizer, herbicide, antibiotics, etc... in use (isolated system, fully organic.)

On the food-scarsity contingency side, I can list homegrown food in at least 2 major food-groups, security from both environmental extremes and hungry neighbours (will be inside the house), and hopefully ability to scale-up the operation as needed.

1) Is the environmental factor assessment mostly correct?

First of all, respect, I found this community a month back it's awesome!

Would mean a lot if someone can give an idea on how to get into climate science, background below:

**Background**: I did my underad in electrical engineering 2 years back (studied data science by taking some courses like AI, Probabilistic Models etc. ). Currently I work in a large american investment bank and my job, though interesting in itself does not motivate me much. But over the last 2 years I've learnt a lot about my domain but don't forsee much more to learn. I do primarily NLP but am also well versed with Image Classification kind of methods, I worked on them in college.

I eventually want to move to Climate Science applications of data science, analyzing geographical and weather data etc. So what are the possible options to do that?

I considered going for MS but it'll be too expensive plus it may not give enough exposure to climate science methods.

I can squeeze in a few hours per week to work on my pet projects, which direction should I take them to get a job in climate science?",True,False,False,False

Me and my SO are in the process of making a game set in a post-climate change world with the intent of guiding the player through the responsible development and use of technology to re-industrialize a dying society in a way which is mindful of, if not beneficial to, the environment.

We are crafting the base game play and scene aspects now, and are looking for resources to help us generate a quasi-realistic environment that will become the player's sandbox. To this end, we're interested in having an as-accurate-as-possible science-bassed depiction of post-climate change biodiversity & abundance (at the level of taxa), climate, weather events, etc. For instance, at the game's start, we are assuming that the landscape is quite arid, human populations are sparse and clustered along coast lines with scarce water primarily coming from rudimentary desalintors, and taxa are mostly flies, birds (which seem to suffer the least impact from CC in general) and jellyfish (which from what I understand thrive in an acidified ocean). 

Here's a vague, non-exhaustive, list of things we are interested in (keep in mind that game-play elements will be a caricature of actual effects which would take centuries if not longer IRL):

* A picture of earth after 200-300 years of unchecked climate change, specifically in North America. What is the climate, how frequent are extreme weather events and related natural disasters, etc.
* The general effects of human activities such as farming and community expansion on surrounding ecologies at the per-taxa level if possible. As an exaggerated game-play element, after improving the local region's biodiversity by replanting forests, reintroducing native species, and improving farming conditions, how is the user punished for careless resource exploitation for profit?
* How atmospheric CO2 affects plant growth and farming for the purpose of caricature (e.g. deforestation and carbon use increase local CO2 -- survivable crops then develop more foliage, but not more nutrition, at the expense of high nitrogen consumption and increased water requirements)
* Loss of native plant species due to climate driven invasion, effective management strategies for invasive plants.
* Microbial biodiversity changes + effects up the food chain
* Climate driven effects on viral and bacterial epidemics in mammals, crops



Unfortunately, neither of us are experts in climate science and are unfamiliar with the major predictions of the accepted literature. We would like any references that might help to inform us, even if they are technical. I am a condensed matter physics Ph.D with some knowledge of mathematical ecology and evolutionary dynamics and he is a Biophysics Ph.D. with experience in development and population genetics with an emphasis on mathematics and computation, so between us we should be able to dissect technical reviews. We also have pay-wall access to the standard journals.

If anyone has a go-to list that would acquaint us with the major points, or favorite forecasting papers, we would be super excited about it. Also if anyone is willing to let us spam them questions occasionally in exchange for a mention in our game, or a character/item or something named after you, that would be awesome too!

Which is fine in a stable climate system as weather patterns will have seasonal rates and models that mimic those patterns and rates will be able to simulate quite accurately what is going on.

I mainly ask because the (currently unknown to me) study is based on the scientists who made the study focusing on permafrost emissions and that is the reason that we are going to breach the Paris Agreement. I myself I am confused about this because I was told by many people and read here as well that over the next 82 years, permafrost melting will only add 5 or 10 gigaton of additional CO2 into the atmosphere. While this is obviously significant, If I take into consideration the time frame than why would this push us past the Paris agreement? Although one of the scientists interviewed in the article of said that this closes the time window on hitting the 2 degree Paris Agreement too 10 to 20 years. Which is odd to me because I could've been certain that was the already existing time frame for it, although I could very likely be wrong. 

So I have three questions; How legitimate is this study? Does the study cover what we already knew? Is the articles headline rubbish? 

So if you know even one of the answers to any of these three questions feel free to post a comment.

I am not the OP, however I see that the OP tried to post their question here but had it deleted due to being a newish account:

From Mar 2011 - Oct 2015, sea levels rose 36mm. An average of 8mm / yr. See source at end of the post.

​

This rate is roughly double the average rate of the satellite era which began in 1993.

​

Since 2015, sea level rise has been less. My cursory interpretation of the data since 2015 has been a) the arrival of the 2015/16 El Nino, b) a return to the accelerated sea level rise in 2017 and c) a return to El Nino conditions in 2018.

​

My limited understanding is that the processes which drive sea level rise are largely chronic (thermal expansion and ice melt / calving) and are periodically offset by events such as El Nino's (1998 and 2016) and extreme precipitation transfers from ocean to land (2010-11).

​

Are there any explanations of the accelerated sea level rise from 2011-2015 that will help a layperson better understand why the 8mm / year should or should not be considered the new normal ?

Peer-Reviewed Studies on the Climate Change Link to Wildfires,25,gmb92,1535522752.0,2,0.96,9b6ofq,climate_science,False,"**Overview and Scope**

With the active wildfire season across much of the western U.S., I've been interested in examining the preponderance of evidence on the subject of climate change and wildfire activity over recent times and future projections. The scope of this research focuses mainly on the modern era of the last half century, examining trends and determining the climate signal (if any). The list covers both regional and global studies. It includes attribution of recent observations (mainly last 50 years or so) and future projections. There's no filter on publication date but I'm emphasizing studies over the last decade. 

Research sources include Google Scholar and the IPCC. This is not meant to take the place of any peer-reviewed synthesis report, which have many contributors and reviewers, but hopefully it's helpful to those seeking information on the topic. Hat tip to paleoclimatologist/dendrochronologist Kevin Anchukaitis, who's [thread](https://twitter.com/thirstygecko/status/1022645955441487872) was sort of a catalyst for me to do the research. 

General recommendation for those in the Twittersphere is this [list of a few hundred climate scientists](https://twitter.com/flimsin/lists/climatescientists?lang=en). Common Tweets are citations to recent studies mixed in with daily thoughts and discussion.

Excellent overview by scientist and Berkeley Earth contributor Zeke Hausfather cuts through the political spin:

[https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-global-warming-has-increased-us-wildfires](https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-global-warming-has-increased-us-wildfires)

Various thoughts: Although related, the set of studies won't cover [global warming's increase in tree pests](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112717306928), which can wreck havoc on forests. There are other big human influences on wildfire trends. Many fires are started by humans and fire suppression can contribute towards reducing/enhancing wildfires at various times. [Land use changes](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017GB005787) had a strong downward impact on fire activity during the industrial age, along with advances in fire-fighting methods, although data prior to the 1980's is sketchy (see the CarbonBrief article). I find the focus on high pre-industrial wildfire activity to be misguided, sort of like saying accelerating sea level rise is no big deal since glacial transitions often had fairly strong century-level changes. There are a few more humans settled around low-lying areas than 10,000-20,000 years ago. Similarly, with human population far larger and closer to burn areas, risks are multiplied. I suppose one way of limiting wildfire risk is to continue industrial age land use trends and get rid of forests. That solution creates other problems. Limiting the climate impact seems to be a good idea. 

&#x200B;

**Conclusions**

The preponderance of evidence suggests that observations over the last few decades have shown increased wildfire trends in area burned in the western U.S., Canada and Russia with significant attribution to human-induced global warming. Projections indicate a substantially increased trend in wildfire activity over the course of this century in the western U.S., Canada, Alaska, and mid to high latitudes in general, although with regional variation. 

Studies in each section are ordered by most recent. As a large proportion of studies focus on North America, I've created 2 sections: one for North America and one for other regions and global trends.

""Evidence for declining forest resilience to wildfires under climate change"", 2017

""Forest resilience to climate change is a global concern given the potential effects of increased disturbance activity, warming temperatures and increased moisture stress on plants. We used a multi-regional dataset of 1485 sites across 52 wildfires from the US Rocky Mountains to ask if and how changing climate over the last several decades impacted post-fire tree regeneration, a key indicator of forest resilience. **Results highlight significant decreases in tree regeneration in the 21st century. Annual moisture deficits were significantly greater from 2000 to 2015 as compared to 1985–1999, suggesting increasingly unfavourable post-fire growing conditions, corresponding to significantly lower seedling densities and increased regeneration failure. Dry forests that already occur at the edge of their climatic tolerance are most prone to conversion to non-forests after wildfires.** Major climate-induced reduction in forest density and extent has important consequences for a myriad of ecosystem services now and in the future.""

""Impact of anthropogenic climate change on wildfire across western US forests"", 2016

""Increased forest fire activity across the western United States in recent decades has contributed to widespread forest mortality, carbon emissions, periods of degraded air quality, and substantial fire suppression expenditures. Although numerous factors aided the recent rise in fire activity, observed warming and drying have significantly increased fire-season fuel aridity, fostering a more favorable fire environment across forested systems. **We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984. This analysis suggests that anthropogenic climate change will continue to chronically enhance the potential for western US forest fire activity while fuels are not limiting.**""

""Controls on interannual variability in lightning-caused fire activity in the western US""

""A data synthesis of cloud-to-ground lightning strikes, climate and fire data across the western US from 1992 to 2013 was conducted to better understand geographic variability in lightning-caused wildfire and the factors that influence interannual variability in lightning-caused wildfire at regional scales. Distinct geographic variability occurred in the proportion of fires and area burned attributed to lightning, with a majority of fires in the interior western US attributed to lightning. Lightning ignition efficiency was highest across the western portion of the region due to the concomitance of peak lightning frequency and annual nadir in fuel moisture in mid-to-late summer. For most regions the number of total and dry lightning strikes exhibited strong interannual correlation with the number of lightning-caused fires, yet were a poor predictor of area burned at regional scales. **Commonality in climate–fire relationships for regional annual area burned by lightning- versus human-ignited fires suggests climate conditions, rather than lightning activity, are the predominant control of interannual variability in area burned by lightning-caused fire across much of the western US**.""

Trends were most significant for southern and mountain ecoregions, coinciding with trends toward increased drought severity. For all ecoregions combined, the number of large fires increased at a rate of seven fires per year, while total fire area increased at a rate of 355 km2 per year. Continuing changes in climate, invasive species, and consequences of past fire management, added to the impacts of larger, more frequent fires, will drive further disruptions to fire regimes of the western U.S. and other fire-prone regions of the world.**""

""Extreme wildfires have substantial economic, social and environmental impacts, but there is uncertainty whether such events are inevitable features of the Earth’s fire ecology or a legacy of poor management and planning. We identify 478 extreme wildfire events defined as the daily clusters of fire radiative power from MODIS, within a global 10 × 10 km lattice, between 2002 and 2013, which exceeded the 99.997th percentile of over 23 million cases of the SFRP 100 km-2 in the MODIS record. These events are globally distributed across all flammable biomes, and are strongly associated with extreme fire weather conditions. Extreme wildfire events reported as being economically or socially disastrous (n = 144) were concentrated in suburban areas in flammable-forested biomes of the western United States and southeastern Australia, noting potential biases in reporting and the absence of globally comprehensive data of fire disasters.

My comment: At first glance it looks like somewhat of a contrarian paper but many of its conclusions overlap the balance of evidence on the other studies, namely area burned in the U.S. and the impact of climate change on future trends. Much of the study is an exercise in framing with comparison to pre-industrial wildfire activity and other human impacts. IMO, the abstract overstates its case. For example, it brushes aside the 1983-2012 western U.S. increase in area burned as having limited value due to length of record, yet relies on shorter timeframes (such as the 2002-2013 satellite trend) to make its case on global area burned trends. Incidentally, that set of data is also cited by Bowman et al. 2017 above.

""Climate-induced variations in global wildfire danger from 1979 to 2013"", 2015

""Climate strongly influences global wildfire activity, and recent wildfire surges may signal fire weather-induced pyrogeographic shifts. Here we use three daily global climate data sets and three fire danger indices to develop a simple annual metric of fire weather season length, and map spatio-temporal trends from 1979 to 2013. **We show that fire weather seasons have lengthened across 29.6?million?km2 (25.3%) of the Earth’s vegetated surface, resulting in an 18.7% increase in global mean fire weather season length. We also show a doubling (108.1% increase) of global burnable area affected by long fire weather seasons (>1.0 s above the historical mean) and an increased global frequency of long fire weather seasons across 62.4?million?km2 (53.4%) during the second half of the study period.** If these fire weather changes are coupled with ignition sources and available fuel, they could markedly impact global ecosystems, societies, economies and climate.""

""Climate change and wildfires in Russia"", 2014

""The application of various remote sensing instruments has shown that the **average vegetation wild fire area in Russia for 1998–2010 accounted for 8.2 ± 0.8 × 106 ha, with about two-thirds of wildfires occurring on forest lands and half on the forested lands. The average annual fire carbon balance during the above period was 121 ± 28 Tg C yr-1, including 92 ± 18 Tg C yr-1 emitted from the forested land. The forecasts based on the General Circulation Models suggest the dramatic acceleration of fire regimes by the end of the 21st century. Taking into account the increase in the dryness of the climate and the thawing of permafrost, this will likely lead to a dramatic loss of forested area and the impoverishment of the forest cover over a major part of the forest zone.""**

[http://archive.is/Dy6iW](http://archive.is/Dy6iW)

has been updated to include an additional study:

**Accounting for changing temperature patterns increases historical estimates of climate sensitivity:** ([https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL078887](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL078887))

Andrews et al., 2018, GRL. Conclusion:

""**the pattern effect increases the long-term Otto et al. (2013) EffCS median and 5-95% confidence interval from 1.9K (0.9-5.0K) to 3.2K (1.5-8.1K).**""

This has been added to the section ""Similar to 1.5-4.5 C ECS consensus range with close to 3 C best estimate (TCR 1-2.5 C)""

The median value of 3.2 C is close the 3 C estimate. An argument can be made that the 5-95% confidence interval range is enough to move this to the ""higher estimates"" section, since the range is a higher confidence interval than the 17-83% 1.5-4.5 interval the IPCC quotes, rendering < 1.5 C less likely. The upper end also appears to extend past the 6 C the IPCC considers ""very unlikely"". The paper was co-authored by Forster and Gregory, 2 of the pioneers of the energy budget approach.

**To summarize, the preponderance of evidence since AR5 indicate:**

1. Large set of studies estimating ECS/TCR to be significantly higher accepted ~~media~~ median value of 3 C and / or range higher than the ""likely"" AR5 range of 1.5-4.5 C. For ECS, values from the studies include: 3.9 C, 5-5.3 C, 4 C (with 90% confidence interval extending only down to 2.3 C), 3.3-4.8 C, 3-6.3 C, and a study with lower bound of 3 C. One study shows TCR to be 2 C, which generally results in considerably higher ECS estimates.
2. Small set of studies estimating ECS/TCR to be significantly lower than the accepted median value/range. Most of those published in quality journals use similar energy budget models.
3. Set of studies consistent with the accepted median value/range. These include studies showing that simple methods from #2 inherently underestimate ECS/TCR

Notably, there's been less peer-reviewed critique of the studies in #1. Taken together, we can conservatively state the lower end of the 1.5-4.5 C sensitivity range is less likely, warranting an increase in the lower bound, similar to the recent Royal Society report on the topic [`https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/Publications/2017/27-11-2017-Climate-change-updates-report.pdf`](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/Publications/2017/27-11-2017-Climate-change-updates-report.pdf). Both of our analyses are arguably conservative assessments, given the set of newer studies indicating higher values. Thoughts?

A recent dubious claim was made elsewhere, asserting:

>Claim:""The climate appears to be less sensitive to changes in CO2 than previously believed. That's a very good thing. There are still lots of different estimates, but the fact that the divergence between energy balance models and general circulation models is widely acknowledged among climate scientists, and has been for five years now, tells us that warming won't be as bad as previously feared.""

[http://archive.is/haQxS](http://archive.is/haQxS)

I've seen various forms of this in certain political realms but it's contradicted by the preponderance of evidence. When pressed, the user (WP) selectively cited 3 papers, 2 of which I cite (one, Otto et al. was included in AR5 and thus was not cited), and one of which placed the median value close to 3 C with a narrowed range on both ends.

Another user responded and cited my previous post on the subject, to which WP responed (and thus my interest in responding) with some spurious critiques. I think it's worth examining them to understand some of the debate tactics used, and observe how self-described ""climate skeptics"" or ""lukewarmists"" rationalize.

First problem with the critique - It skips over the sizable list of high-end ECS/TCR estimates (see #1 above). On a related note, had I taken WP's approach, I'd have just cited some of these high-end estimates, ignored the rest, then asserted with confidence that climate sensitivity appears to be higher than previously thought - very bad news. Or perhaps I'd start with the conclusion and only selective cite a few studies when pressed. A thorough analysis of the evidence, however, renders the conclusion more nuanced.

Second spurious critique - Complaint over journal filtering criteria:

>WP:""Did you notice how many papers they discounted? From the authors ""Criteria"" section, ""I'm mainly sticking to higher Impact Factor journals."" So he's purposefully leaving out journals that tend to publish energy balance model papers""

The user did not support this with any evidence. The criteria of using a filter that leaves out obscure journals has nothing to do with energy budget models. In fact, my observations are that most energy budget model papers are published in better quality journals. Otto et al. (Nature Geoscience), Lewis and Curry (2015, Climate Dynamics), Marvel et al. (GRL), Andrews et al. (2018, GRL), and older studies such as Forster and Gregory (2006, Journal of Climate), among many, are all published in higher quality journals, so that is a strange argument.

Third spurious critique - Median ECS/TCR values that don't very precisely match 3 C and 1.8 C respectively should not be categorized as ""consistent with AR5 and the typical median around 3 C and 1.5-4.5 likely range.""

This is an odd line of argument, since the user's argument claiming ""very good news"" implies a much more significant shift than the \~5-10% deviations in each direction shown in this section. Details:

One study's conclusion on ECS: "" are well described by the currently accepted range of an increase of 1.5 K to 4.5 K per doubling of CO2.""

>WP:""Doesn't name a best estimate for ECS. Uses the expanded AR5 range, which was reduced from the AR4 range.""

Red herring argument. Our scope is not to determine how estimates have changed since AR4, but how estimates of climate sensitivity have moved since AR5, either median or range. That the paper uses the AR5 range (1.5-4.5) indicates that it's consistent with AR5, and thus appears in this section. Had the lower bound been raised substantially it may be a candidate for being included in the higher estimates section.

Study:""Inhomogeneous forcing and transient climate sensitivity Shindell, 2014, Nature Climate Change ""the lowest end of the range of transient climate response to CO2 in present models and assessments (<1.3 °C) is very unlikely."" Press Release""

>WP: ""That's a bottom boundary and is well below the TCR of 1.8°C in AR5.""

1.8 C TCR is the median in AR5. By definition, a bottom boundary is going to be lower than that. Recall that Lewis and Curry placed their median TCR value at 1.3 C. Shindell renders that unlikely.

>WP:""Doesn't name ECS. Revised upwards from what value?""

The study does estimate ECS. Marvel et al.: ""accounting for differences in equilibrium forcing efficacy revises the estimate upwards; our new best estimate(using efficacies derived from the iRF) is 2.6 C (Fig. 2a). If efficacies are instead calculated from the ERF, the b est estimate of ECS is 3.0 C (Fig. 2b).""

The value of Otto et al. was 1.9. 3 C is more than a 50% increase from 1.9 C.

Study:""We find that including observations over the hiatus reduces the most likely value for ECS from 2.8 °C to 2.5 °C, but that the lower bound of the 90% range remains stable around 2 °C.""

>WP:""ECS is stated outright to be less than 3.0°C. This should have been filed under the ""less than""

While the median is somewhat lower, the lower bound of the 90% range in that study is raised to 2 C, higher than the best estimate of the small set of simple energy budget models WP prefers. Recall that the IPCC 66% range has a lower bound of 1.5 C. This study is a higher lower bound with higher confidence. So we'd have at least as good of an argument for including this in the higher range section, since 1.5 C was the previous lower bound of an less certain ""likely"" range (66%) in AR5. By ignoring that critical piece (after considering the range to be important above), WP's argument is weak.

Study: ""produces a current best estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.9 C (1.7–7.1?°C, 90% confidence). ""

>WP:""Also less than 3.0°C, though very close.""

Oh my this is getting silly. 3 -> 2.9 = about a 3% less median (very good news?), yet note the even higher lower/upper bounds of 1.7-7.1 C compared with 1.5-4.5 C.

Study: ""Here we present a new emergent constraint on ECS that yields a central estimate of 2.8 degrees Celsius with 66 per cent confidence limits (equivalent to the IPCC ‘likely’ range) of 2.2–3.4 degrees Celsius.""

>WP:""Less than 3.0°C for sure, but note that this is for GCMs in particular! This means that it's not a reduction of 0.2°C, but a reduction of 0.6°C! ""

The categorization is in regards to the general best estimate 3 C value and 1.5-4.5 range, not with the methodology used to derive it. Had one taken this approach, many of the studies in this section would have been included in the first section. We've consistently seen major upward revisions with regards to energy budget models that WP relies on to make his case. Such a categorization, however, would not be consistent with the scope.

Study: ""best estimate for TCR of 1.66 °C, with a 5–95% range of 1.0–3.3 C, consistent with the climate models considered in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report.""

>WP:""Though they like to say ""consistent with,"" 1.66°C is lower than AR5's 1.8°C for TCR. This, too, was misfiled. It should have been under than ""less than"" category.""

Note again that the upper end of the range is increased from AR5, so we'd have a similarly weak argument for including it in the high estimates section. Details:

AR5 on TCR:""The grey shaded range marks the likely 1 C to 2.5 C range, and the grey solid line marks the extremely unlikely greater than 3 C""

Study:""with a 5–95% range of 1.0–3.3 C, consistent with the climate models considered in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report.""

Neither the 0.3 C increase at the upper end of the range nor the 0.14 C reduction in the median is particularly significant, both within 10%. Thus the reason the study itself states the values are consistent with AR5.

Getting back to the new study added (Andrews et al. 2018), the ECS median here is higher than 3 C (3.2 C), although within 10%. Using very precise criteria, their 3.2 C is inconsistent with AR5 and should be put in the first section of higher estimates. The range arguably might warrant that, but not the median.",True,False,False,False

Opinion regarding potential inflection point in US climate policy,4,buddhist62,1531094741.0,0,1.0,8x6300,climate_science,False,"By way of background, I believe that climate change represents the greatest existential threat to human civilization. 

A big part of the problem is that humans have not evolved to respond the threat indicators associated with climate change. It is invisible, unprecedented, slowly evolving, complex and action to stop it seams outside the reach of most individuals. 

Another obstacle is that the interest groups who benefit from the status quo have a powerful lobbying presence and put a lot of money into advertising on mainstream media which doesn't adequately cover climate change IMO. 

I'd like to share my best guess as to the scenario and timing of a future transformation in policy and see where others are on the topic so i can learn more about alternative scenarios. 

My hunch revolves around coming sea level rise (SLR) and the research around marine ice-sheet instability (MISI). The recent tripling in recorded Antarctic melt rate is an indicator that SLR could be in the early stages of a ""hockey-stick"" style growth pattern.  

The recent past indicates acceleration of SLR. The 20th century average of 1-2mm/yr to the satellite era (since 1993) average rate of 3+mm / yr. The most recent decade has been quite volatile with an average of 4+mm / yr including 2 years with 10+mm growth and 2 negative SLR intervals.

While there is plenty of volatility in short-term SLR measurements, the pattern that emerges over the next 5-10 years as a whole will IMO be very informative regarding the scientific community's ability to predict future SLR. 

If the hockey stick continues to emerge in the data, financial markets will price in the expectations and the consequences of market adjustments would precede large scare inundation. 

Increasing flood insurance rates and actual or expected flood damages will put pressure on coastal real estate. Municipalities dependent upon real estate taxes will simultaneously be hit with a lower tax base, higher borrowing costs (from credit agency downgrading) and increased adaptation and mitigation expenses. The ability of local governments to meet that challenge is questionable. .

If / when the science of SLR prediction becomes better established and accepted by the marketplace, the ability to forecast the domino effects of SLR into the future has the ability to transform financial markets and force the federal gov't to take an active role.

If continued acceleration in SLR doesn't materialize, then my hunch is wrong. If it does, I'd give it ~ 10 years before we're forced into a fundamental pivot on policy.

I'm attaching a link to an NOAA site which tracks global temperatures at thousands of locations.

Data covers the last 365 days. Summary format is the default with ability to drill down to detailed records.

Records are kept for both minimum and maximum temperatures and their is a clear trend in that the most common type of new record being set in the current environment is record high minimum temperatures.

The distribution of all-time records in the last 365 days is as follows:

My new video… Our Unravelling Civilization… root cause: abrupt climate system mayhem … accelerant: war,20,paulhenrybeckwith,1697046968.0,2,0.83,175keto,climate,False,"This video is about the big picture of our unravelling civilization. 

Ever increasing numbers of men, woman, and children are dying from extreme weather disruption consequences of our angry planet undergoing abrupt climate system mayhem. 

Many other humans, or rather “human animals”, according to the Israeli defence minister are being deliberately killed by bombs fired and dropped by angry people against other angry people. 

As soon as a government dehumanizes other people, they are setting up conditions for genocide on a large scale. Does Israel really mean to kill over 2 million people in the Gaza Strip. Yes? No? If no, then how many will satisfy their blood lust? 50,000? 100,000? What Palestinian to Israeli death ratio are they aiming for? What ratio will cause a northern attack on Israel? What ratio will cause other Arab countries in the Middle East to enter the fray? What ratio will cause Iran to fight? What ratio will satisfy the US and other western countries, and have them suddenly pivot from supporting genocidal massacre to becoming humanitarians? Lots of questions. I guess we will experience some answers over the coming weeks.

Do the math. Without water, people die after a few days. Without food they wither away; just look at the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland. Without electricity, people are thrust back into the dark ages. When these poor souls are enclosed by a fence, with no ability to leave via land or sea, and are bombarded by one of the most powerful militaries the world has ever seen, and backed with unwavering  support from the US, Canada, and other western powers expect a Gaza Holocaust. A Gaza Genocide. A Gaza Apartheid. 

We can no longer assume that cities knocked over today, whether it be by floods, superstorms, wildfire incineration, derechos, or wars, will ever be rebuilt. Even western cities like New York (remember Sandy) or New Orleans (remember Katrina); in fact every place in the world are not without risk.

If you live in a nice house, in a nice neighbourhood, in a nice city and country anywhere on the planet count your blessings. Do not assume permanence. It does not take much to have everything you know turned to dust and ruin in the blink of an eye. 

When there is no longer any money or materials to rebuild destroyed places, people will move to other places. Over time, there becomes fewer of these “other places”. In fact, vast regions of our planet will be rendered completely uninhabitable by heat and drought. 

Civilizations around the planet are in rapid decline, and collapse occurs as “death by a thousand cuts”, not all at once, simultaneously. Anyone with open eyes and half a brain can see that happening, before their very eyes, today.

The report, a first-of-its-kind global analysis, sheds light on the scale of child displacements caused by floods, storms, droughts, and wildfires from 2016 to 2021 while projecting future displacement trends.

Our climate system is lurching uncontrollably towards a world of Heaviside Functions. In most climate parameters, including global temperature. 

Within this video, as I stroll about in nature with free-rein Newton, I called it “Delta Function” behaviour, but mathematical delta functions are really singularity spikes that in an instant go up to infinity and then in the next instant go back to zero. More accurate is Heaviside function behaviour where we shoot upwards in an instant, and then stay up. That is where we are headed. 

Last video I went through the must-read report by the OECD on tipping points, and this video I chat about some of my own additional thoughts.

A likely scenario is further slowing or shutdown of AMOC (even a slowdown seems like it may be enough) to topple the Earth system apple-cart. The ITCZ shifts southward so it essentially stops raining in Europe and in the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon burns out, to be quickly replaced by savannah. Maybe new tropical forests set up further south in South America. We lose between 1/2 and 2/3 of our grains and maize growing regions. Indian Monsoon rainfall drops by half. Short term, the northern hemisphere cools, and dries, but the southern hemisphere bakes, Antarctic sea ice collapses (even more), and West Antarctic Ice melt shoots upwards. 

I’m just getting started. Instead of me typing more and you reading more, you’ll just have to watch the video.

Please donate to http://PaulBeckwith.net to get more and more climate mayhem stuff from me.

"My new video: Increased Rainfall over Greenland by 33% Means Less Snowfall and Thus Less Snowfall for Accumulation. Basically, less ice is being formed in Accumulation regions from less compressed snowfall… Bad for ice mass balance on Greenland",8,paulhenrybeckwith,1696360011.0,2,0.9,16z0hl5,climate,False,"A very comprehensive and significant peer reviewed scientific study shows that over the period of time from 1991 to 2021 there has been an increase of rainfall over the massive ice sheets on Greenland and a corresponding decrease in the snowfall that over time gets compressed into firn and then accumulates as new ice on the ice sheet. 

Thus, not only is the Greenland ice ablating, and thinning, and calving at increased rates, but less snow is falling to cause ice accumulation, since more of the precipitation is falling as rainfall instead of snowfall.

Not only that, but we are seeing an increasing number of so-called Atmospheric River Events (ARs) reaching over the Greenland Ice as the jet stream slows down and the north-south jet stream waves are amplified. More and more of these warm, moisture laden atmospheric rivers are causing torrential rain events over Greenland, where more than 300 mm of rain falls in a single day, even at very high altitudes on the ice sheet. This warm rainfall further ablates the ice sheet and runs down into crevices and moulins and accelerates glacial flow rates. Also, these atmospheric rivers are filamenting into fingers of extremely high water content updrafts (called “rapids” in the paper; poor name choice in my view) that wind their way up the valleys of the combined land-glacier orography (topography) reaching very high elevations on the ice sheet (even up to 1.5 km) where rainfall is generated over areas that have previously been accumulation regions generating new ice on the glacier over time from compressed accumulated snowfall.

All in all, we can expect ever increasing ice mass loss in Greenland as abrupt climate change accelerated, with a corresponding acceleration of global sea level rise. Also, as Arctic Sea Ice continues to decline, we can expect accelerating coastal ice shelf collapse and then a corresponding acceleration in the glacial flow rate of the massive, on-land ice sheets. 

Not a pretty picture; the devil is always in the details and this paper provides many of these details for accelerating Greenland ice-mass loss.

James Hansen is arguably the giant of all climate scientists. I was very fortunate to meet him a few years ago at a COP climate conference, and chat with him on a CEF (Climate Emergency Forum) video. 

He has just published a new paper on updates on the climate system: http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2023/FlyingBlind.14September2023.pdf

About a month ago, I covered his August 14th paper, and this video is an update on his newest stuff.

This paper is vitally important in giving us a clear picture of what we can expect in the next few years.

A confluence of factors is driving up global average temperatures of the atmosphere and oceans and we can expect warming and climate extremes to notch up to much higher record setting levels. 

We ain’t seen nothing yet. We are only getting a taste this summer of what is to come in the next year or two.

1) Average global temperatures trended upwards at 0.18 degrees C per decade before 2010. With less aerosol forcing, since 2010 to now it has risen between 0.27 and 0.36 degrees C (this was all in the previous paper “Global Warming in the Pipeline”)

2) We can expect an additional rise from El Niño; it is really just getting started. A super El Niño will easily drive global average temperatures well above 1.5 C perhaps later this year but highly probably for the first six months of 2024. El Niño is much more powerfully warming the planet in the year after it starts, so in 2024 since it started this year. 

3) Solar irradiation is peaking soon, and basically adds a forcing of +0.1 W per m**2 on top of everything else.

4) We are missing a vast area of sea ice around Antarctica, but Antarctica is still in its winter darkness. Come Fall and Winter for Northern Hemisphere dwellers, the sun rises in the Southern Hemisphere and the huge extra area of dark open ocean around Antarctica will absorb huge amounts of extra sunlight.

5) The Earth Energy Imbalance was 0.6 W or m**2 ten years ago (400,000 Hiroshima bombs a day) but is now 1.22 W per m**2 (more than double; namely 800,000 Hiroshima bombs per day); the most recent value is a staggering 1.46 W per m**2.

6) By May of 2024, it looks increasing likely (almost certain) that the 12 month average global temperature will exceed 1.5C, with the monthly value close to 1.8C or maybe even as high as 2C.

It is already rapidly rising and the additional effects listed above will greatly accelerate the rise. 

As a result of this unfortunate confluence of events, we can expect the global climate turmoil in the last few months to substantially worsen. When it does, expect the media and mainstream scientists and politicians to espouse their excuses and concerns, but none of that matters if they do not slash fossil fuels. 

Last month Lahaina in Hawaii was incinerated and many people are still missing (I think they have returned to ashes and dust), and also 90-95% of the town of Enterprise in Canada’s Northwest Territories was incinerated. Global floods are ongoing (look at the inundation of NYC a few days ago), heatwaves are killing countless people, and global governments just don’t give a damn, since they are subsidizing fossil fuels at record high levels of 7.1 Trillion Dollars per year.

And the world goes on, at least for most people.

The results are very sobering, or at least they should be, but they probably won’t be. With Business-As-Usual, burning fossil fuels must essentially be considered manslaughter, of mostly poor people in the future by richer people today.

Basically, when we burn fossil fuels and create another trillion tons of CO2 emissions, and the global average temperature rises above 2C we can expect roughly a billion humans to die, so the simple math means that one future life is killed per 1000 tons of carbon.

It is hard to visualize 1000 tons of CO2, or even 1 ton of CO2, since this gas is invisible to the human eyes. I show you some interesting visualizations of how much 1 ton is (basically a 10 meter diameter sphere), and how a days emissions in a place like New York City dwarf and bury the Empire State Building.

When people talk about what could be the solution for carbon emissions the first solution discussed is renewable energies but this past summer i heard someone, that has a photovoltaic panel at home, wonder about just blasting the AC during the day to have the house colder at night  based on the energy being produced during the day not being consumed. Of course money wise its a good idea, but it’s an environmental atrocity. You are overusing a panel and a AC unit that have to be manufactured with special materials that have to be mined plus gases etc… etc… This situation makes me wonder how can we prove that going carbon neutral will not just create another unpredictable issue on each renewable. Aren’t we just worried about carbon (because of rising temperature) but changing to something else will create other problems. Isn’t the only solution actually start limiting how energy consumption (food, transportation, commodities). Am I misnterpreting Lavoisier?",False,False,False,False

It is worth noting that despite this significant difference, we find ourselves deeply concerned about a mere 2-degree increase over the past century. It may seem disproportionate, and while I acknowledge that my calculations are simplistic, it appears we still have approximately 500 years before the Earth returns to its previous equilibrium.

Currently, we are transitioning from an ice age back to the planet's normal state. The Jurassic period, which lasted an astounding 56 million years, experienced prolonged elevated temperatures. This raises the question: Why do we consider today's temperature to be the correct one? It is crucial not to be swayed solely by the sensational tactics employed in climate discussions.

Is the Amazon Rainforest still on fire?,15,breadboy3167,1588774371.0,2,0.94,gekr84,GlobalClimateChange,False,"In the midst of the pandemic, I suddenly felt the urge to look for any updates on the fires happening in the Amazon but to my dismay, I only found articles from 2019. I can’t seem to find any coverage on this anywhere.

Of course, maybe it’s the pandemic but I’m just worried if it’s actually the suppression of media coverage similar to August 2019. But here’s what I could find:

During the Amazon Country Summit on August 28, 2019, it was announced that the countries sharing the Amazon rainforest, excluding Venezuela, will hold a summit in Colombia on September 6, 2019, to discuss the ongoing Amazon fire situation. Which led to the involved countries signing a pact to coordinate monitoring of the Amazon forest and disaster response, and a better information network to coordinate their responses.

(Paraphrased &amp; summarised from the [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Amazon_rainforest_wildfires))

However, no further news other than when Brazilian President, Jail Bolsonaro [scaled back on efforts to fight illegal logging, mining and farming,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/world/americas/brazil-amazon-deforestation.html) which have led to widespread destruction of the Amazon Rainforest (again)

I Googled “Amazon Wildfire 2020” and set the search settings to show me articles from this year and only found 6 of them.

•[(1)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.mongabay.com/2020/02/upset-about-amazon-fires-last-year-focus-on-deforestation-this-year-commentary/amp/) •[(2)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/01/10/world/amazon-rainforest-wildfires-climate-change-study/index.html) •[(3)](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/jessica-carey-webb/amazon-still-fire) •[(4)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1ZE2HL) •[(5)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/news/world/1224783/amazon-rainforest-fire-latest-news-has-the-amazon-rainforest-fire-stopped/amp) •[(6)](https://news.gsu.edu/2020/02/20/forest-fire-an-update-on-the-amazon-wildfires/)

I know we’re in a pandemic right now with this outbreak getting worse but I’m concerned for the lack of media coverage on this topic especially considering how President Jair Bolsonaro backed out from his conservation efforts and went ahead with continuing the deforestation of the Amazon.

Ten hottest years on record: not exactly forever ago,13,24-cell,1579999906.0,0,0.85,etzkf8,GlobalClimateChange,False,"The data is in from NASA and NOAA, and 2019 was the second hottest year on record, measurements taken by land and ocean surface temperatures combined. Both agencies put 2019 in second place below 2016, when a strong El Niño took place.

In early 2015, NASA posted [this](https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/2224/) article about the ten hottest years on record at the time, and briefly reviewed a world event from that year. The purpose of this is to get people to see the hottest years not just as numbers but to associate them with events. This helps people understand just how recent these years are- anyone out of high school can easily remember them.

I want to do the same thing now, so here are the ten hottest years on record according to an average of NASA and NOAA data, with an event associated. I'm pretty sure the original NASA article only used its own data and it's been updated, so some years on that page may be flipped around here. The events for 2010, 2009, and 2005 were taken directly from that page. (And I've also posted this on a few other forums.)

&#x200B;

**1. 2016 - Louisiana flooding**

 In August of the hottest year ever recorded, catastrophic floods devastated southern Louisiana and submerged thousands of buildings. Governor Edwards declared a state of emergency and called the flooding historic and unprecedented. Many scientists believe climate change will make these events in Louisiana more common in the future. 

**2. 2019 - Australian bush fires**

 In late 2019, the 2019-20 bush fire season began in Australia, and it is the worst bush fire season in Australia since at least 1974. 2019 was also the hottest and driest year on record in Australia, and there is a drying trend in Australia around the regions of the bush fires. Dryer and hotter conditions are more favorable for bush fires, and climate change will likely make these events more common in the future. 

**3. 2017 - Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria**

 2017 had an extremely active and dangerous hurricane season in the Atlantic. Harvey was the costliest hurricane on record and produced catastrophic floods in Texas. Irma caused a lot of destruction in the Caribbean as well as Maria, which left parts of Puerto Rico without electricity for months. It is currently unclear if climate change is changing, or will change, hurricane frequencies or intensities. 

**3. 2015 - Paris Climate Conference**

 In December 2015, 196 countries from around the world met in Paris to set a plan to keep global temperatures below the famous 2C limit relative to pre-industrial temperatures. An agreement was made and ratified, but there are no enforcement mechanisms, and a few world leaders of carbon-intensive countries since then have said they want to exit the agreement. 

**5. 2018 - Eruption of Anak Krakatoa volcano**

 The Anak Krakatoa volcano between the Java and Sumatra islands in Indonesia erupted on 22 December 2018 which then triggered a deadly tsunami, killing about 400 people and injuring 14,000 others. It is so far the deadliest volcano eruption of the 21st century. 

**6. 2014 - Ebola outbreak**

 In 2014, there was an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Liberia which spread to neighboring countries, and the World Health Organization declared an emergency on 8 August. The outbreak lasted until mid-2016 and infected roughly 30,000 people, of which about 40% died. 

**7. 2010 - BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico**

 The Gulf of Mexico oil spill began on April 20, 2010. It lasted 87 days and spewed about 260 million gallons of crude oil into the ocean, making it the worst marine oil spill in history. Eleven people and countless marine animals were killed. 

**8. 2013 - Snowden leaks of Global Surveillance**

 In June 2013, CIA employee Edward Snowden leaked thousands of classified documents from the NSA, revealing extensive global surveillance of hundreds of millions of people, looking through things such as phone calls and internet history. To avoid prosecution by the U.S. government for leaking classified information, Snowden fled to Russia, where he resides today. 

**8. 2005 - Hurricane Katrina**

 Hurricane Katrina formed in the Bahamas on August 23, 2005 and made landfall on August 29, causing flooding and severe destruction along the Gulf Coast. New Orleans, Louisiana, was especially hit hard when levee failure caused over 80 percent of the city to become inundated. 

**10. 2009 - Copenhagen Climate Conference** 

 The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference was held in Copenhagen December 7-18, 2009. The goal of the conference was to negotiate a deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and hold the temperature increase to less than 2 degrees Celsius, but participating nations failed to reach an agreement.",True,False,False,False

Second, I really feel this  article is counterproductive on some level.  After all, we were just  told two weeks ago that we only have 12 years to save humanity.  With  some articles literally calling for the end of humanity by 2050.  So,  how do these numbers track to those, and if they don't why are we  surprised when those we are trying to engage are less than engaging.

Given  this is our daily truth, and we are trying to engage as many people as  possible, I'd really enjoy hearing from the group about how and what we  need to do better if our goal really is to better engage and catalyze  change.",True,False,False,False

As sea levels rise and the fierce cyclones, the salinity intrusion into coastal areas, impacting the lives of millions of residents of Bangladesh.

Around [35 million people are living on the edge of a climate catastrophe](http://www.zulkernaeen.com/exclusive-report/salinity-intrusion-coastal-bangladesh/), at the coastal belt of the Bay of Bengal.

We often spoke about the immediate impacts of storms and tidal upsurges. But we hear less about the [resulting salinity increase and its long-term consequences](https://www.eurasiareview.com/30042018-a-harsh-reality-of-bangladesh-water-security-salinity-intrusion-and-internal-migration-oped/). Each time saltwater from the sea contaminates farms and water sources when a tidal surge sweeps the inland.  Along with drastic economic effects, as its consequences, worsening of crop yields, malnutrition, and diseases are significant concerns. 

>!Nearly 98% of freshwater reservoirs and ecosystem is lost.!<

As consequences, high and long-term salinity exposure has deteriorated the coastal lifestyle and acute health crises.

The salinity gradients in groundwater increased several-fold over previous decades. A significant change is observed in the salinity of the groundwater aquifer over the last ten years. The salt content is at its highest level during the summer season.  

>!45% of people drink pond water without taking any disinfection measures.  !<

Here, life is so miserable when access to fresh drinking water. That is why local people can't regularly drink enough water to meet their bodies ' demands owing to severe drinking water shortages. 

Unfortunately, the average potable water collection time takes around four hours a day. Moreover, around 45% of people use pond water for drinking without taking any disinfection measures. 

>!Not enough money to get treatment for their disease. !<

The long-term consequences of the regional water crisis cause residents suffering from high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases, a high prevalence of kidney diseases, skin diseases, and diarrhoea. Also, the average household health expenditure is high. 

Thus, more than 95% of residents do not get proper treatment because of high treatment costs and lack of medical support at the community level.

>!First food, then treatment.!<

Despite having no adequate money to meet the regular household needs, their average health treatment cost has increased by around 24%. So, most low-income people try to ignore their health diseases owing to food insecurity and financial crisis. It leads to a thought process of ""first food, then treatment.""",True,False,False,False
