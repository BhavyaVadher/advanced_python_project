I can't fucking stand working at Amazon,350,tacocravr_,1679420613.0,173,0.91,11xoblw,antiwork,False,"I have ADHD. I work at Amazon as a picker. I am in fucking hell. 10 hours of nothing but the sound of robots and conveyors belts, 4 days a week. I am currently on the verge of a panic attack, with 5 more hours to go. This job is the best opportunity I've gotten in a while, but it's so fucking hard not to take VTO or just straight up quit every single fucking day.

I don't know what to do. Nothing I do distracts me enough. I even tried putting an earbud in and it didn't stop me from thinking about the time. I covered up the clock, still couldn't stop thinking about it. Every minute is a year, every hour is a lifetime, I'm so fucking tired and bored and sweaty and I just want to go home but I can't afford to leave this job.

I have an appt tomorrow to talk about ADHD meds with a psych but I don't even know if they'll help or if I'll be able to afford them.

I wish I could just zone out and do my job but I just can't seem to stop counting every second.",True,False,False,False
I hate working at Amazon,39,Journalist_Willing,1677656206.0,42,0.77,11exn5j,AmazonFC,False,"I'm not certain if it's just how things are going and have been going for a while but something about working at Amazon is starting to just drain the soul outta me. 

Oddly enough it isn't the workload or the hours that makes it insufferable. Amazon honestly pays pretty well for the expected workload and experience and their time off options are beyond better than anywhere else I've worked before.

I think the problem with working at Amazon, for me at least, is just how disconnected the individual is from the business. Normally, I wouldn't have much issue with there being a healthy barrier between the business and the individual but it is more than that. I think that the problem is that the system and management, which operates it, are so out of touch with the common AA. Although I have to concede that there are so many people working at Amazon, many of which working flex, that it's nearly impossible for any human to not neglect the human aspect.

I digress, Amazon is so disconnected from the common AA at times that I truly think that somebody with absolutely no ability, experience, or even work ethic could get promoted before somebody with all three, and that they could achieve being promoted or hired ahead of somebody who is way more qualified simply through charisma and an ability to pretend that they know what they are doing.

I came to this realization when I had a problem at work because I was problem solving and I didn't know something. I asked multiple people and each time they would point me to somebody else. I had problems with this in the past but this time kind of broke the camels back.

&#x200B;

Put simply, I don't think I plan on making a long term career with Amazon and intend on getting a new job. Funnily enough, I might get recognition and an offer only AFTER I've made the decision to stop caring.

&#x200B;

Sorry about the rant.

Edit: I'm %100 aware this is my problem and not everyone else's that works at Amazon and this isn't meant to be a call out as if it's any managers or even the business being malicious. Just a rant, nothing more. Thank you.",True,False,False,False
Anyone actually like working at Amazon?,52,DarthGabe2142,1635479871.0,130,0.87,qi45hh,AmazonFC,False,"Hello all,

Does anyone here like working at Amazon? I am a college student that works part time at a sort center and I actually like my job. It pays $19.25 an hour and I get a 401K and some other benefits as well. 

Amazon is actually my first job ever after I graduated high school in 2018. I left during lockdown, later worked at a supermarket after lockdown eased . That gig lasted only  7 months. I returned to Amazon May of 2021 and have been working at the sort center since.

I don't mind working alone and being responsible for myself. I have good sneakers with memory foam and know I will experience pain for a while.

Is working at amazon worth it or nah?,4,M6_20,1675801574.0,51,0.59,10wc4e6,AmazonFC,False,"I don’t have a job and Im looking and obviously Amazon always pops up on indeed & stuff. But I’m curious about the warehouse and delivery driver jobs. Honestly though I heard Amazon be slaving people and the rules are super strict and you be like non stop working & stuff. Plus usually the only thing positive I hear people say about amazon is the pay. 

Im just curious if the company is worth working for or is it a no go for the most part. Also I hear they hire pretty fast but it’s because like people quit so often so idk what to really think of it",True,False,False,False
What’s one big reason why you’re still working at Amazon (besides needing the money)?,120,dedtalktoyourself,1692168855.0,211,0.94,15si4ud,AmazonFC,False,"I have 3. 

&#x200B;

1 is that I’ve made some really great friends who I’ve been working with now for almost 7 years that make going into work a little less shitty. 


2 is the health insurance. I needed a $96k surgery and they paid all of it. 

&#x200B;

But 3 and probably my biggest reason for staying so long at Amazon is the time off policy. If you need time off for whatever reason there is almost always a way to get it. You may not always get paid for your time off but you can 80% of the time get time off when you need it. 

&#x200B;

If you have sick, personal, vacation or UPT you can literally take all the time off you want if you’ve got the time to cover it. You can also leave early or come in late. I leave early almost daily and don’t tell anyone. When I’m tired and super sore I’ll just go to break and then walk out and go home if I feel I need to. I know it’s not like this at all sites but at mine vacation is auto approved. Meaning I can submit it for the same day and it’s approved instantly. 

&#x200B;

If you need time off to bereave a loved one. You can get that fairly easily. If you have an illness or injury it’s usually easy to get time off for that. I literally went on a vacation last month and just went in and submitted a ploa and nobody cared as long as I gave a couple weeks notice in the app. I also was dealing with something really stressful last week and couldn’t get myself to go into work. I just wasn’t in the right head space so I went in the app and put in for a mental health day and was instantly approved. 

&#x200B;

My point being is that I’ve never in my life worked at a job that is sooooo lenient with giving its employees time off and it’s genuinely the main thing keeping me here. Because obviously I can name 800 different shitty things about working at Amazon like how I’m ruining my body but damn being able to just say fuck it I don’t wanna go into work today and not get in trouble for it is so nice.

1) What is your daily routine like? What exactly does your role entail?

2) Are you given one role and stick to that role or shifted around the warehouse in different roles as needed?

3) How long are the average shifts? From what I remember looking up they're 10-12 hours with maybe 1 break.

4) Do you have to make a quota of packages that goes through your station daily?

5) What benefits are offered and how many hours and how long do you need to be with them to receive the benefits?

I worked at amazon for about only a week and got fired. I am just sooooo angry. During the orientation the supervisor did not have enough scanners and the supervisor was very very bald and mean

You don’t even get a break. It takes time to get to the break room, so you’re wasting precious break time cause it’s on the opposite side of the warehouse. By the time you get there you only really have 3 minutes left before you have to get back to work.

If that ain’t bad enough, the supervisor told me to work faster. That by itself is illegal believe it or not. I mean I am working as fast as I can!!!!!

All of this work for 16$ an hour. That isn’t going to get me anything rent wise in the Bay Area. I was working 10 hours a day busting my back for 16 an hour. I also had to pop pills. This was because I was sore after working my 10 hour a day shift. Amazon needs to supply ibuprofen to their warehouse.

You might as well bring your bed to work. After you’re done, you are going to be too tired to do anything! But the catch is you gotta be at work the next day. That’s the thing with these warehouse jobs at Amazon. They don’t care about you they just want profit, numbers and for you to move quickly.

I got fired for using the bathroom!! I had to go really bad. So I got my co-worker to handle my section. I went and handled my business and came back only to find my supervisor very angry staring at me. I awkwardly start doing my work and he speed walks at me with a raised voice. He accused me of sneaking out and chatting on my phone or whatever. I said I wasn’t doing that(which I wasn’t) and he told me he had to let me go. It was hella embarrassing and I am just so mad!

I worked at Amazon HQ when it was spread across the International District and downtown Seattle. From 2007-2010, I helped to build the marketplace that we now rely on. Specifically, it was my job to find and vet new vendors to join. I remember sitting in a product meeting where product managers were introducing us to this e-reader called Kindle. (I will never forget because the PM had uploaded either a copy of Kama Sutra or some other sex help book that a few of the young sales members found and began laughing about.)

At our All-Hands, customer obsession was driven into us. Jeff B would take to the stage and tell us how important it was to leave every customer satisfied. We were just an emerging e-marketplace, evolving from a used bookseller. I wasn't there at the beginning, but I was there close enough that I want to share my perspective on GME.

GameStop launching a NFT wallet gave me the same tingly feelings I had holding that first generation Kindle model. 

Back then, a lot of customers compared us to e-Bay, and we wanted to separate ourselves from them. I remember pouring through vendors, scanning products, and critiquing images so that each vendor conformed to our marketplace standards. I remember getting early morning emails (like 2am) from Jeff B who received an email from an angry vendor I had declined. I would have to re-review, explain my rationale, then make a plan on how to address the issue so no other vendor experienced that same dissatisfaction. (I burnt out after a few years as I couldn't keep up with the stressful environment, so I can't speak on Amazon currently.)

I promise there are a lot of folks who don't know Amazon's humble beginnings. Especially this current generation who grew up with Amazon as the default shopping destination, with its two-day shipping as the standard delivery time (I remember 5-6 weeks for shipping and handling.)

I genuinely feel that Gamestop is about to make a similar transition. From that as the used video game brick & mortar chain to a massive marketplace and tech company. I've tried to explain to my Boomer relatives what an NFT was, then I realized it was a recycled conversation from when I tried to explain to them what an e-reader was over a decade ago.

I don't know the mechanics behind it, but I think RC's vision of the GameStop marketplace is based on Jeff B's. I remember when self-publishing e-books became a thing (kinda like how early NFT creators profited off the scarcity of products) and how independently produced works became accessible. I don't think we have yet seen the full potential of NFTs, but I am confident RC does, and that's why I invested in GME. 

I like to think MOASS will happen, but if it doesn't, I am still comfortable with my investment.",True,False,False,False

# Overview

By now, everybody should have heard about Amazon Career Choice. It is a program where after 90 days of working at Amazon (as 20h+/week blue badge L1-L4), Amazon pays 100% of your tuition up to $5250 every year for you to get your high school diploma/GED, associates, bachelors and/or certificate programs.

The general information can be found in my other post - [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/rnnudh/new\_features\_coming\_soon\_to\_career\_choice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/rnnudh/new_features_coming_soon_to_career_choice/)

But I'm talking about  [Western Governors University (WGU)](https://www.wgu.edu/partners/amazon.html) \- which covers 100% of your tuition for fulltime associates. They might not have as big of a choice/variety with bachelors like SNHU, but they have a bachelors in IT and Business fields.

# About WGU

Western Governors University is accredited by the **Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU)**, an  institutional accreditation body  of colleges and universities in a  seven-state region that includes WGU’s headquarters of Utah. NWCCU  provides the accreditation of many other major institutions, including  the University of Washington, University of Oregon, Gonzaga University,  University of Utah, and Brigham Young University, to name a few.

# Cost

I talked with WGU Enrollment Counselor and Amazon Career Choice people. I can confirm it is 100% free for full time associates. For part time, you have to pay $2650 out of pocket to get same benefits as full time associates.

~~* Normally, WGU costs 3.7k per semester. WGU charges per term, not per subject/credit. It is a flat rate per term. You can do as many subjects you can in a term.~~
* For Amazon employees, WGU has a different plan. 
  * Term: Your term is from when you start to the end of that year, and you can start the first of any month as long as you complete all the prerequisites. So if I start March 01 22 my term ends Dec 31 22. Essentially, I get 10 months of study towards bachelors in a year paid by amazon, because I started March. If I started January, 12 whole months.
  * Courses: Amazon Employees have to submit a voucher through career choice for every course. If you are full time, the voucher should cover all the as many courses as you can possibly do. For part timers though, it's different. Amazon will pay till 2.5k and then you have to pay for every course you do, not upfront.
  * While paying using the Career Choice benefit and/or out-of-pocket you will be charged $325 per credit. When fulltime/part-time associates reach the $5250 mark any subsequent courses till the end of that year will be free.

Quoting the WGU Career Choice website for Part Time associates:
> Note: As part of the Amazon Career Choice program, a full-time Amazon employee has up to $5,250 and a part-time employee has up to $2,625 to spend on WGU courses during a calendar year. These amounts are paid by Amazon. In addition, once an Amazon employee through the Career Choice program spends $5,250 in a calendar year, any additional courses they decide to take during that same calendar year are free. Part-time associates, to meet the $5,250 free-course threshold in a calendar year, would need to pay $2,625 out of pocket after using their $2,625 Amazon benefit. 

# Majors

Here are all Bachelors for Business and IT fields at WGU which Amazon pays for.

Business College

* Bachelor of Science - Business Administration, Healthcare Management
* Bachelor of Science - Business Administration, Accounting
* Bachelor of Science - Business Administration, Information Technology Management
* Bachelor of Science - Business Administration, Marketing
* Bachelor of Science - Business Administration, Human Resource Management

* Bachelor of Science, Cybersecurity and Information Assurance
* Bachelor of Science, Cloud Computing
* Bachelor of Science, Network Operations and Security
* Bachelor of Science, Data Management/Data Analytics
* Bachelor of Science, Computer Science
* Bachelor of Science, Software Development

# Class

The big thing about WGU is that they are a self paced option and 100% online. Meaning you could literally complete the whole freaking bachelors in 6 months. That's what **some (select few)** people did. But I understand that's not for everyone. Most people usually take 2-4 terms to finish in average. Check out the [r/WGU](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU) subreddit to get a general overview.

# Summary

Have a look at the options and their syllabus. Who doesn't want **debt free tuition** for **free** ? Well I do. That's why I plan to start Bachelors in Cloud Computing from March 01 2022.

&#x200B;

Go ahead, pick your selection and work towards getting that degree. Might have to pick a side job when you start studying. But do something. Get out of that picker, splitter, jam clear, packer, customer returns and all other roles and move forward into a meaningful role.

# Help

Got questions ? Site HR won't have answers to many of your questions. Contact ERC at 1-888-892-7180. 

You can also try accessing the Career Choice website through the A to Z app:  navigate to “Tools and Resources” and select “Career Choice”. Go to “Help” > “Send us a question” if you can view it there.

For any WGU related questions, you can ask in the r/WGU sub and also their discord server https://discord.gg/unwgu where we have a lot of people doing the degrees and also alumni who can help.

"Finished my MBA last December, previously worked several years at Amazon and still no job 40 applications later?",363,deluna_sense8,1696734414.0,400,0.86,172omlp,resumes,False,"Hi guys,

Apologies in advance if this post comes off a tad whiny--I'm exhausted after a long day and just overall discouraged.

Anyways, I'm really starting to worry about what I'm doing wrong. I now have an MBA, international experience, and I have some big names on my resume.

After I left Amazon in 2020, I took a few months of rest and then began applying to jobs I really liked (program/product management, strategy, marketing and similar). When I wasn't getting any traction, I figured it was because most of the jobs I was applying to had MBA preferred. So I studied, was accepted, and enrolled at IE, which is considered one of the top business schools in Europe. I did the 1 year program and graduated last December, but chose to do an extension program for my 2 concentrations (Strategy and Healthcare) and to have more time to job hunt (for simplification purposes, on my resume I just put my MBA timeline as lasting through June of this year).

Unfortunately, for the last 6 months of my studies I was primarily looking at jobs in Europe, and I didn't realize just how low the pay was (Glassdoor sucks in EU, and there's very little other pay transparency) until about graduation. After that, I was worried that I had wasted time, but ceded to the fact that I'd have to move back to the US for work in order to comfortably keep up with my financial obligations (namely my $100k Sallie Mae loan with high interest and a couple other loans/CCs with recently increased rates).

Some extra details for easier reading:

\-I began applying to US-based jobs at at the beginning of this year.

\-I previously worked in tech but was initially only applying to healthcare/pharma sector companies since I was trying to pivot into that

\-I probably could've pursued something with Eli Lilly Germany, but I don't speak ANY German and know from my best friend that life outside work is difficult if you don't, so didn't really explore that

\-I DID try to pursue roles for Eli Lilly in the US, but have struggled to find anything relevant and was passed over for the couple roles I was referred for early in the year

\-I've had only 4 interviews for US-based roles, but only through referrals (through other business school alumni). Half were with bio/pharma companies, the other half were tech (but not FAANG). The ones with the first few companies went ok, but with the last 2 companies I was sure I would be selected--they went that well. Sadly, I ultimately did not receive an offer for any

\-I only gave a definitive salary number for 1 company, and it was one of the ones I felt I interviewed really well at (Asked for $160k base for a position based in Florida)

\-I've asked for feedback from both companies that I felt sure I would get an offer from, but both declined citing company policy (Lame)

\-Most of my rejections have been automated emails (no interviews), including 3 for roles I had been referred to. Some roles I never even received emails for

\-I've been looking at roles in Seattle, California, NYC (and around), Chicago, Florida, Boston, or remote.

\-I cannot go back to Amazon

\-I've since resorted to helping my dad manage the family restaurant, which has been struggling lately and has practically NO processes in place since my dad single-handedly runs it...honestly, it's a miracle it's survived this long. I'm practically working for free and unfortunately it has taken a lot of my time away from serious job hunting the last several weeks

\-Relatedly, I am wondering if I should disclose that my current role as GM is for my family company  (since I'm worried that being a GM for a small restaurant after doing an MBA seems a bit like a step back), or if it would seem as if I took the easy route post-MBA if I disclosed this

\-I've actually considered taking over the restaurant, but neither myself nor my dad have the capital required to maybe turn it around (I was planning on just helping finance changes once I had my next corporate job), and I'm not entirely sure I'd even want to tie myself to that job after having witnessed my dad be a slave to it for practically my entire life

I've got a few theories as to why I am struggling, but hoping to get some more definitive, objective feedback since I'm really feeling application fatigue..and possibly the beginnings of depression :/

EDIT: haven’t gotten the chance to read/respond to all the comments, but wanted to add a couple clarifying points:

-I was born and raised in the US, so don’t require US work sponsorship…but if this is not obvious then that’s a concern 🤔

-I’ve been selective in the roles I’ve applied to tailoring my resume to most (versus blindly applying to dozens at a time), hence why they’re so few. Nonetheless, I do agree that maybe it’s time to be less picky

-I think I see now that salaries have changed since I left tech—I get it and will amend my expectations. However, I don’t think this has been my primary barrier since I only gave that number to 1 recruiter during a screen (and I was still passed onto the interview with HM after )

-While there’s always room for improvement, I also don’t believe my interviewing skills are the primary issue either—I only ever got a handful of interviews in the first place (and only with referrals) leading me to believe it’s my resume..also, I myself used to interview while at Amazon and am well versed in all types of behavioral questions, STAR method etc etc

-Ideally, I’d like to hear from people with similar profiles (MBAs, worked in tech/biotech/big brand name companies, in a major metropolitan city) OR from people who hire these profile types regularly..if you’re one of these, it would help me greatly if you mentioned it in your comment, thanks!  :)

EDIT #2: 

I'm still reading, taking notes, and responding to many comments..but I sincerely appreciate the majority of responses I've gotten!

Just also wanted to add because I realize I left it out--I don't want to take it off the table but getting back into tech is my 2nd choice right now. I'd ideally like to get into *bio*tech, but realize it's a niche market still..it's why I've kept both my tech and healthcare/pharma related roles on there. I will either be removing the restaurant role or revamping it to showcase everything I'm overhauling.

And no, I did not major in bio/chem/similar, but I've always been a science nerd (hence the cancer research, Lilly roles, and healthcare concentration) and am looking to pivot into that space in some capacity that will leverage more rounded skills and experience.

EDIT #3!

Yes, I've removed the restaurant experience and made a few other changes..thanks everyone for their feedback! I'll try to update once I get something, hopefully soon :)",True,False,False,False

Working at Amazon with a bachelors degree. Am I settling too hard?,32,Throwawaynojutsu_11,1693313618.0,27,0.94,164hpc4,careeradvice,False,"Lol I feel like I just make chronically bad decisions which is why I ended up here in the first place. All I just want to do is live off of my art (maybe be a freelancers) or have a well paying job to where I can draw but my dream just seems so far away.  
For context I graduated with a Japanese major back in 2018. (Truthfully, even though I majored in Japanese, I was never really good at it and I'm still shit at it). Fast forward 6 months after uni I went to Japan to teach English for about 2 years. My life seemed to be going into the right direction until it wasn't. I came back to America due to some mental health issues and some difficulties I had with a coworker (who seemed like that had NPD but that's another story). I was invited back by my aunt so I could work on my mental health and get back on my feet. But, living with her didn't pan out so eventually I left and found a job at a daycare.  
I worked there for a short while until I found a job (kinda) relevant to my major. I got a job at a Japanese sales company as an inside sale rep. (Honestly I didn't even have use Japanese for this job at all). Just when I thought I was moving in the right direction I got sacked 3 months later for not meeting their expectations by the time my probation period came to an end. This really hurt me quiet a bit I'd say this was my first ""real"" job out of college.  
After that I got a job at the library as a part time assistant. I worked at the library for a bit over a year. Didn't pay anything and was difficult to move up in but it was a peaceful job for the most part. I decided that I would try to go back to University this year for a different degree in Digital Design so I  can go into an Art related career field (which has always been my real passion). Soon before this semester was supposed to start, I quit my job to  work at Amazon. At first, I though working at Amazon part time was an okay way to earn extra cash on the side to help me pay my way through school. I was only going to work there to help save money for car, pay for other expenses, and try find a good internship for a career field.  
Unfortunately my plan A didn't work at all. I didn't have enough financial aid to pay for my tuition this time around and I failed to apply for and grants of scholarships for this semester too.  I have the option to take out a private loan but my student loan debt is already high enough I really didn't want to go that route. Sadly, I had to drop out for this semester until I can save enough money for the next semester. :(  Now all I have is Amazon....  
I guess I can try to still find some type of internship still but it's hard with the hours I work. I basically have no life outside my job working here and I'm starting to feel like a slave. I remember about a week ago I cried at my station when my ""supposed to be"" first day of class came around and I was stuck in a crappy warehouse. I just felt so ashamed a like a failure for not amounting to anything and all of my plans not working out.  
I keep trying to cheer myself up saying to myself that working at Amazon for a short while isn't that bad. They do have a tuition assistance program that I can use if I start school next semester. I only have 1 year left for the degree I was going back for and the tuition assistance would cover nearly an entire semester for me.  
But honestly, my ego still feels shattered working here haha.  
I think about my family's criticism about me aiming to low in life and kind of makes me feel like I'm just a disappoint now.  
Just when I thought I was getting over my feelings at bit something today happen at work. I saw one of my former patrons who I used to help out quiet a bit with their projects at Amazon. They seemed surprised to see me there and lowkey even a bit disappointed (maybe that's how I interpreted it). Made me think that I gave the impress that I would amount to something more but here I am, just a another disposable warehouse worker at Amazon.  
Sorry a bit too much self loathing, I just got off of work this morning recently and I'm really tired lol.  
So after my very long explanation, what can I do to improve my situation? Am I really aiming too low and make dumb decisions? Should I stay at Amazon until I get the tuition assistance money?

"I am Mark Porter, CTO at MongoDB. I love Tech, and especially delighting people with databases. I also used to work at Oracle, NASA, Amazon, and Grab. AMA.",5802,MarkLovesTech,1611250841.0,737,0.9,l23dxl,IAmA,False,"Hi Reddit, I'm Mark Porter.

After I joined MongoDB in July 2020, people have often asked me ""Aren’t you one of the SQL folks? Why would one of you join MongoDB?""

For me, since I started programming before I was a teenager, it was always about technical puzzles. Then when I got into business, it became about delighting customers; SQL and relational tech were just a means to that end. Databases are indeed amazing because of the promises they make around data in terms of consistency, ease of use, and durability that they make. A couple years ago, I sat with one of my old relational friends, before MongoDB was even a gleam in my eye, and we decided that 30+ years into our careers, databases were still hard to use by operators and developers, but especially developers (though cloud has made operations a lot easier). They were also still unpredictable and didn’t defend themselves against misuse. Not only that, but scalability and distribution were bolted on as afterthoughts rather than core elements of the product - making scaling either difficult or impractical - and always brittle.

In fact, my biggest frustration during the Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL project was how hemmed in we were. We had SQL constraining us on the top, with ORMs on top of that - leaving it hard to use and no real way to fix that. Who wants to embed obtuse SQL in their code? The PostgreSQL community (while amazing and inspiring), further constrained us by not letting us change scale out, transactions, or anything else of substance. Compatibility was sacrosanct. Not only that, but the PostgreSQL community typically takes 2-3 years to accept any architectural changes into the code base, and every one is a negotiation. So at Amazon, for Aurora (both for MySQL and PostgreSQL), all we could really do was innovate on the storage layer - mostly because it was just so very broken and not scalable in the way we envisioned. The marketing saying that ""Amazon Aurora is a new database"" is not quite true - it's a combination of an amazing distributed, replicated, fast storage system glued onto the bottom of PostgreSQL and into the middle of MySQL.

As I got to know MongoDB, I realized that MongoDB has very few constraints. We are the stewards of the language interfaces so that we can merge seamlessly with every language - people program MongoDB and Realm databases using their native data structures, not by programming in a different language within C, Java, Node, Python, etc. We are the custodians of the drivers so we can seamlessly implement failover, scaled reads/writes, and client-side encryption. The server tech is natively built from the ground up to offer scale and distribution - you can run a single MongoDB cluster on all three major cloud providers if you want. You can even run it on your laptop or in your own data center, building you a much better ramp from the data center to the cloud. The final straw was that I saw MongoDB’s vision for a full data platform via our Atlas cloud service. For example, we have integrated search directly into the cloud offering - no additional infra to stand up or manage. And we allow you to federate queries directly across your data lake and MongoDB, transparently, and even to age data into your data lake automatically and still use the same queries.

As a result of all this, I decided that the future of my career was to get back into databases and help build the best data platform for modern applications that I could; the one I’d been envisioning since I was at JPL working on storing science data on a 1MB microVax.

But that's enough for now - I'm excited to be here! Ask me anything!

PS: I have some of our senior engineers on standby in case I cannot handle your deep and detailed queries - I’m still only 6 months in ;).

I work at Amazon.com. I found something besides your order in our warehouse.,708,IntergalacticCakepan,1443018067.0,157,0.8,3m2huo,nosleep,False,"I'm shaking, holding a lit cigarette between my quivering lips. I just put in for a personal leave and I don't know if I'll be coming back. I have to tell this story. There is a black van parked in my driveway, and I'm scared I know too much. For obvious reasons I will not be divulging the location of our facility or inner operation details. Let me start from the beginning.

I've been working as an Amazon associate for five years. It started out innocent enough, running product to sortation lines, assisting with workflow, touching millions of boxes. I was quickly whisked away to what is referred to as Problem Solve, fixing product issues and shipment errors. Luckily for me after I put my time in, I was promoted to a leadership position. I was stoked! I started last night in my new role and was super excited about being trained. All that would change quickly. 

Half way into the night, management decided that there wasn't enough product and let the associates go home. So there I was in a 1,000,000 square foot building at midnight, with a skeleton crew scattered throughout the building. Now, if you've ever been inside an Amazon building you would know that during normal operations it's filled with the sounds of warehouse work. Thousands of feet of conveyers grinding and whirring, lift trucks beeping, and alarms going off constantly. The noise is oddly comforting. Last night there was none of this. The building was completely silent. Every footfall echoed throughout its cavernous metal frame. 

I was instructed to do a quality check our non-conveyable product to ensure it was ready for the shipment in the morning.  Now, non-con, as it is so fondly named, is the product that is outside our normal shipping parameters and cannot be processed at our facility, thus is tucked away in the darkest corner of our building. Even during the day I don't prefer going back there, mostly because I'm afraid of being run over by a lift truck. Tonight was different, there was no one around. So I donned my reflective day-glo vest and ventured to the back, counting my steps as I went.

Upon arriving in that dark and dusty corner I heard a rustling coming from the racks. The racks are where we store broken equipment and non inventory product, they take up about an eighth of the floor and go 50 feet high. I assumed that it was an temp hire, messing around in the back, possibly trying to pocket some broken iPods to sell on eBay (happens a lot more than I care to admit). So I call out.

""Hey! I'm coming out there, put whatever you're messing with back, get to your assigned station before I find you, and we won't need to file a report.""

Silence.

""Seriously, you're not going to get through the metal detectors with it anyway, give it up, losing your job over a cheap buck isn't worth it!""

Shuffle.

""OK, I'm calling Security. You had your chance."" 

At this point I'm pretty sure I'm dealing with a thieving employee who is too afraid to move. I remove my radio from my belt and click over to the security channel. It emits a high pitched squeal that rings my ears. I instinctively clap my hands to my ears and drop the radio, which clatters some distance away in the dark.

""Fuck."" I whisper to myself in the dark. 

""Whrrrgrrbbl."", the dark corner replies.

Frozen in terror, this is the first point where I realize it MIGHT NOT be a disgruntled and criminal employee. I back up against the row of racks behind me and wonder why the motion censor lights are not kicking on near me. 

**buzz-click**

The row of lights a hundred feet from me flickers on. *What's moving over there?* I thought. Heart racing and legs quivering. Then in a matter of three seconds, it travels towards me with inhuman speed.

*buzzclickbuzzclickbuzzclickbuzzclick*
  
The lights are popping on at an alarming rate and about this time I gathered all my courage and moved towards it, charging at knee level, just like my dad taught me to tackle. I feel something breeze past me, and a brush of what felt like sandpaper on my face. At this point real instinct kicks in and I grab in the dark for something to smash a face with. My fumbling hand finds a discarded piece of pallet, riddled with nails. The weight of the 2x4 comforted and encouraged me to keep going, despite my jelly legs. I wobbled blindly though the inky black racks, at this point only hoping for survival and to keep my job. I feel three distinct claws ride down either side of my spine and the swell of warm blood follow. Feeling like Hacksaw Jim Duggan, I swing wildly in the dark until I hear a loud **thunk**. 

I stumble back, finally locating the emergency flash light at the end of the row. I flick it on, hoping against hope that it was a sneaky janitor and all I will lose is my job and not my life. What I found is going to live in my nightmares for the rest of my life.

A pool of jet black black liquid shimmered back at me, with tracks leading further into the darkness. I followed, dragging my kill-stick with me, slightly more curious than terrified. Slightly. After 30 feet of half-claw, half-drag marks, the tracks stop. I'm nose to nose with a cold, concrete wall. Ragged breath rasps above me, going against my instincts, I shine the light up, and two orange disks gleam at me from the rafters. 

*hrrriiiisssss* 

I can only describe the figure as black, with shining wetness. It looked as if someone had skinned an iguana and sewed human legs on backwards. It saw me at skittered across the rafters towards me with a low purr. I slid under a rack and turned my light off, praying for a reprieve. The creature crab-walked to my location, upside down, nostrils flaring with each sniff, hunting for my meat. It came 4 inches from my face, still searching. I could smell the rotten meat on its breath. Fearing death, I closed my eyes as it snarled, and... Nothing.

Nothing happened. I opened my eyes to find lights popping on throughout the building and people chattering as they were coming in for their shift. I slid from under the metal frame and pointed my flashlight into the dark ceiling cavern

*purrrggggrrr*

""Hey, IntergalacticCakepan, did you get that shipment ready?"" 

""Uh-uh."" 

So I'm home. I called Seattle, where our headquarters is located and told them my story. They have put me on a mental health leave. I don't know if senior leadership knows about this creature in the dark, or if it lives there. All I know is Amazon started in a garage in 1994. Now it's one of the biggest online stores in the world. Was a dark force called upon to ensure the success? Are sacrifices needed? I don't know.

Let me describe what the usual day is.

There are only 2 things that happens. You either wait and do nothing or endless packaging items into boxes, bags, and envelopes.

It is mentally draining me as the time goes by painfully slow and you have to do that for 10.5 hours. It is physically demanding on my body. It is most of all psychologically torture to me.

Constant loud alarms, doing the exact same thing hour after hour after hour with no end in sight as one minute seems to last 5 minutes and you have to keep doing the same putting items into packages all 10 hours, and then after all that is done with, you get to go home exhausted and have to hurry and eat, shower, and go to sleep because IT'S ALREADY ALMOST TIME FOR YOU TO GET UP TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN!!!

Did I mention in a 10.5 hour shift, they only give you 3 breaks? 2 15 minute breaks and 1 fiercely strict 30 minute lunch break.

I am broken and need to find a different job fast because I honestly can not do much more of this like I am thinking of quitting today. I can't do another 10.5 hours of that. You know amazon is bad when it makes walmart look like a great place to work at. This is the second worst job I ever had!

Anybody on WOTB, please hear my warning, do NOT work at amazon even if you are not going to do packing items. Don't be fooled by the high paying job, it's a trap! It's not worth $17. Not even $100.

I feel awful that I am unable to push myself to hold on for another week or two. What really was the breaking point was when they scheduled a MANDATORY work day on one of my days off.

Thoughts on working at Amazon as Cloud Support Engineer II,2,Honest_Priest,1695664650.0,0,0.75,16rz2bz,ITCareerQuestions,False,"I am working at an MSP for Google Cloud and the job is pretty much boring and the pay is very low for a Consultant.  
A recruiter reached out to me on Linkedin asking if I could work for AWS as a Support Engineer for containers but I am curious to know how the organization is and how work life balance works there.  
Will the clients be anyone who has cloud premium? or is this more of a professional environment where I will be guiding semi competent clients?  
Is there going to be 100 calls a day and bombard with issues every minute of the day? Or will I be able to take my time and think issues through before sending them a solution?  
How do vacations or off days work?  
How do their start and stop times work? Is it strict whereby “we monitor your movements on the PC to see if you’re doing your shift”.  
Do we work on major holidays?  
Are co workers chilled or is it man-eat-man?  
I would love to connect with anyone who works there and give me a bit of insights on what to expect : )",True,False,False,False

Deciding whether to keep my job with Manpower at IBM Poughkeepsie or work at Amazon Fishkill.. What should I do?,23,culturedtropical,1697309886.0,31,0.9,177wesy,hudsonvalley,False,"I currently work a Manufacturing tech job at IBM through Manpower agency and have been here for almost 2 years and havent been hired on as an actual IBMer yet due to the hiring freeze that seems to be taking forever to thaw. No overtime unless the one week of a busy quarter. 

I see Amazon Fishkill is hiring for over 100  warehouse positions and pays $1 more than my current job and has better benefits including free tuition with WGU which I plan on attending next year for software engineering. 
 I am learning programming languages and strive for a career in developement. 

Does anyone work for the Amazon in Fishkill? How was the overtime and how is it working there?  Just considering my options. Thanks in advance!",True,False,False,False

Is working at Amazon safe as a woman?,0,Jezikr,1667755954.0,27,0.5,ynwnw7,FASCAmazon,False,"I'm (19F) about to start working at a fulfillment center and at first, I was excited to be working somewhere where I can just keep my head down and not socialize much but I keep seeing posts and reports about rampant harassment, and honestly, it's really scaring me. 
I hate confrontation so I usually just try to be polite and neutral when someone is making me uncomfortable, especially men, but from what I've read here and elsewhere online many people skip the verbal harassment and go straight for inappropriate touching or flashing and worse harassers and assaulters aren't even fired or punished in some way.
I'm lucky enough to not absolutely need a job right now but working at Amazon would make my life a whole lot easier.

(sorry about formatting I use mobile) 

TLDR: I'm 19F; is it safe to work here? Or should I look elsewhere even if I get paid less and it conflicts with my schedule?",True,False,False,False
